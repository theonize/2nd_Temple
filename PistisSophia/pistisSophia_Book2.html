<P>John also came forward, he said : " O Lord, command me also that I say the 
interpretation of the words which thy light-power once prophesized through 
David." But Jesus answered and said to John: "Thou also, John, I command thee to 
say the interpretation which my light-power prophesized through David.: 
<P>10. " Mercy and truth have met one another, and righteousness and peace has 
kissed one another." 
<P>11." Truth has sprouted from the earth and righteousness has looked forth 
from heaven." 
<P>John answered, however, and said : "This is the word which thou hast said to 
us once : " I came forth from the height, I entered into Sabaoth the <I>Good</I> 
, I embraced the light-power within him." Now at this time : " Mercy and truth 
have met one another." Thou art the mercy which was sent forth from the places 
of the height through thy Father, the First Mystery, who looks within. He sent 
thee that thou shouldst have mercy on the whole world. Truth, on the other hand, 
is the power of Sabaoth the <I>Good</I>&nbsp; which bound itself to thee, which 
thou didst cast to the left, thou, the First Mystery which looks forth. The 
Little Sabaoth the <I>Good</I> received it, he cast it into the matter of 
Barbelo, and he preached on the true place of the truth in all the places of 
those of the left. Now it is that the matter of the Barbelo which is a body to 
thee today. "And righteousness and peace have kissed eachother." Righteousness 
is thou who didst bring all the mysteries through the Father, the First Mystery 
who looks within, and thou didst baptise the power of Sabaoth the <I>Good</I> . 
And thou didst come to the place of the archons , thou didst give to them the 
mysteries of the height and they became righteous and good. Peace, on the other 
hand , is the power of Sabaoth, namely thy soul which entered into the matter of 
Barbelo. And all the archons of the six aeons of Jabraoth have made peace with 
the mystery of the light. And: "Truth which has sprouted from the earth." . This 
is the power of Sabaoth the <I>Good</I> which came&nbsp; forth from the place of 
the right, which is outside the Treasury of the light, and which went to the 
place of those of the left. It entered the matter of the Barbelo, and it 
preached to them the mysteries of the place of the truth. Righteousness, on the 
other hand, which looked froth from heaven is thou, the First Mystery, which 
looked forth, having come forth from the spaces of the height with the mysteries 
of the kingdom of light. And thou didst come down upon the garment of light 
which thou didst receive from the hand of Barbelo ; thou didst come down upon 
him who is Jesus our Saviour, like a dove. Now it happened when John had spoken 
these words, the First Mystery who looks forth said to him : "Excellent, John, 
thou beloved brother." 
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 64</FONT></B> 
<P>The First Mystery continued again, saying : " Now it happened, the power 
which came forth from the height, namely I myself, whom my Father sent to save 
the Pistis Sophia from the Chaos - now I with the other power which came forth 
from me and the soul which I received from Sabaoth the <I>Good</I> , they came 
towards one another , they made one outpouring of light which was exceedingly 
bright, I called Gabriel and Michael down from the aeons, by the command of my 
Father, the First Mystery who looks within, and I gave them the outpouring of 
light. I caused them to go down to the Chaos to help the Pistis Sophia, and to 
take the light-powers which the emanations of the Authades had taken from her, 
to take them from them and to give them to the Pistis Sophia. And in the hour 
that they brought the outpouring of light down to the Chaos, it gave light 
exceedingly to the whole Chaos, and it spread in all their (the emanations?) 
places. And when the emanations of the Authades saw the great light of that 
outpouring, they were all afraid together. And that outpouring drew forth from 
them all the light-powers which they had taken from the Pistis Sophia. And the 
emanations of the Authades did not dare to take hold of that outpouring of light 
in the dark Chaos; nor were they able to take hold of it by the artifice of the 
Authades who had hold of the emanations. And Gabriel and Michael brought the 
outpouring of the light over the body of the matter of the Pistis Sophia. And 
they cast into her all her lights which had been taken from her. And the body of 
her matter received light completely. And furthermore, all her powers within 
her, whose light&nbsp; had been taken away, received light and they ceased to 
lack light, because they received their light which had been taken from them, 
because the light was given to them by me. And Michael and Gabriel, who served 
me and brought the outpouring of light to the Chaos, will give the mysteries of 
the light to them ; these are they who were entrusted with the outpouring of 
light which I gave to them, I brought it to the Chaos. Michael and Gabriel did 
not take any light for themselves from the lights of the Pistis Sophia , which 
they took away from the emanations of the Authades. Now it happened when my 
outpouring of light cast into the Pistis Sophia all her light-powers whch it 
took away from the emanations of the Authades, she became completely lighted. 
And also the light-powers which were in the Pistis Sophia, which the emanations 
of the Authades did not take away, rejoiced again and they were filled with 
light. And the lights which were cast into Pistis Sophia gave life to the body 
of her matter which had no light in it, which was about to be destroyed or was 
being destroyed, and they set up all its powers which were about to be 
dissolved. And they received light-power for themselves, they became as they 
were at first and they increased in perception of the light. And all the 
light-powers of the Sophia recognised one another through my outpouring of 
light. And they were saved through the light of that outpouring. And my 
outpouring of light, when it took the lights from the emanations of the 
Authades, which had taken them from the Pistis Sophia, it cast them into the 
Pistis Sophia. And it turned itself and came up out of the Chaos." Now when the 
First Mystery said to the disciples that&nbsp; those things happened to the 
Pistis Sophia in the Chaos, he answered and said to them : "Do you understand in 
what manner I am speaking to you?" 
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 65</FONT></B> 
<P>Peter came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning the interpretation of the 
words which thou hast spoken, thy light-power once prophesized through Solomon 
in his Ode: 
<P>7. "There went forth an outpouring, it became a great broad river. <BR>&nbsp; 

<P>8. It gathered all things; it turned towards the Temple. 
<P>9.It could not be restrained with restrainers and buildings, nor could the 
artificers of those who restrain water restrain it. 
<P>10.It was brought over the whole earth and it took hold of all things. 
<P>11.Those who were on the dry sand were given to drink, their thirst was 
relieved and quenched when they were given to drink by the hand of the Most 
High. 
<P>12.Blessed are the servers of that drink to whom the water of the Lord is 
entrusted. 
<P>13.They have changed dry lips;&nbsp; those that were fainting received joy of 
heart. Souls were given life, and breath was cast in so that they did not die. 
<P>14.They have set upright limbs that had fallen ; they have given power to 
their feebleness, and light to their eyes. 
<P>15.For they have all known themselves in the Lord; and they have been saved 
through a water of eternal life." 
<P>Hear now, my Lord, and I will give the discourse openly. As thy power 
prophesied through Solomon : "There went forth and outpouring, it became a 
great, broad river." : that is, the outpouring of the light was spread out in 
the Chaos in all the places of the emanations of the Authades. And again, the 
word which they power spoke through Solomon: "It gathered all things, it brought 
them over to the Temple." : that is, it gathered out of the emanations of the 
Authades all the light-powers which they had taken from the Pistis Sophia, and 
it cast them into the Pistis Sophia again. And the word which thy power spoke; 
"It could not be restrained with restrainers and buildings" : that is, the 
emanations of the&nbsp; Authades were not able to restrain the outpouring of 
light in the walls of the darkness of the Chaos. And the word which it spoke : 
"It was brought over the whole earth and filled all things." : that is, when 
Gabriel and Michael had brought it over the body of the Pistis Sophia, they cast 
into her all lights which the emanations of the Authades had taken away from 
her, and the body of her matter gave light. And the word which it spoke: "Those 
who were on dry sand were given to drink." : that is, all those received light 
who were in the Pistisn Sophia, those whose light was taken away at first. And 
the word which it spoke: "And their thirst was relieved and quenched.": that is, 
her powers ceased to lack light and they were satisfied with light, because they 
were given their light which had been taken from them. And again, as thy power 
spoke: "They were given to drink by the hand of the Most High" : that is, they 
were given light by the outpouring of light which came forth from me, <BR>the 
First Mystery. And as thy power spoke : "Blessed are the servers of that drink" 
: that is the word, which thou didst say: Michael and Gabriel who have served 
brought the outflowing of the light to the Chaos and furthermore they brought 
her up. They will give to them the mysteries of the light of the height, these 
to whom the outpouring of light was entrusted. And furthermore as thy power 
spoke: "They changed dry lips": that is, Gabriel and Michael have not taken for 
themselves from the lights of the Pistis Sophia, which they seized from the 
emanations of the Authades, but they cast tem into the Pistis Sophia. And again 
the word which it spoke: "Those that were fainting received joy of heart." : 
that is, all the other powers of the Pistis Sophia, those that were not taken 
away&nbsp; by the emanations of the Authades, rejoiced greatly and they were 
filled with light through their fellow lights, because they were cast into them. 
And the word which thy power spoke: <BR>"Souls were given life, breath was cast 
in so that they did not die": that is, when they cast the lights into the Pistis 
Sophia, they gave life to the body of her matter, from which its lights had been 
taken at first and which were about to perish. And again the word which thy 
power spoke : "They have set upright limbs, that have fallen, or lest they 
fall." : that is, when they cast her lights into her, they set upright all her 
powers which were about to collapse. And furthermore as thy light-power spoke : 
"They have given power to their feebleness": that is, they have received their 
light again and they have become as they were at first. And again the word which 
it said : "They have given light to their eyes." : that is, they have received 
perception in the light, and they have known the outpouring of light , that it 
belongs to the height. And again the word which it spoke : "They have all known 
themselves in the Lord." : that is, all the powers of the Pistis Sophia have 
known one another through the outpouring of light. And again the word which it 
spoke : "They have been&nbsp; saved through a water of eternal life." : that is, 
they have been saved through the wole outpouring of light. And the word which it 
spoke : "The outpouring of light gathered all things and gathered it in the 
Temple." : that is, when the outpouring of light took all the lights of the 
Pistis Sophia and seized them from the emanations of the Authades, it cast them 
into the Pistis Sophia, and it turned itself, it came forth from the Chaos. It 
came down upon thee, thou who art the Temple. This is the interpretation of all 
the words which thy power spoke through the Ode of Solomon."Now it happened when 
the First Mystery heard these words <BR>which Peter said, he said to him 
:"Excellent, thou blessed one, Peter, this is the interpretation of the words 
which were spoken." 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 66</FONT></B> 
<P>The First Mystery however continued again&nbsp; with the discourse. He said 
"Now it happened before I brought the Pistis Sophia up from the Chaos, because I 
was not yet commanded by my Father, the First Mystery who looks within, now at 
that time after this the emanations of the Authades knew that my outpouring of 
light had taken away from them the light-powers which they had taken away from 
the Pistis Sophia, and had cast them (the outpouring of light had cast them) 
into the Pistis Sophia. And furthermore when they saw the Pistis Sophia lighted 
as she was from the beginning, they were angry against the Pistis Sophia. And 
they cried again to their Authades, that he should come and help them, so that 
they should take away the powers which were in the Pistis Sophia once again. And 
the Authades sent out of the height, out of <BR>the thirteenth aeon, he sent 
another great light-power. It came down to the Chaos like a flying arrow, in 
order that he (the Authades) should help his emanations, so that they should 
take the lights from the Pistis Sophia once again. And when the light-power came 
down, the emanations of the Authades, which were in the Chaos and afflicted the 
Pistis Sophia, were encouraged greatly.And they again pursued the Pistis Sophia 
with a great terror and a great disturbance. And some of the emanations of the 
Authades afflicted her. For one of them changed to the form of a basilisk, 
having seven heads; again another changed to the form of a dragon; with the 
other previous power of the Authades which has a lion-face; and with all his 
other very numerous emanations. And they came together, they oppressed the 
Pistis Sophia. And again they brought her to the places below the Chaos. And 
again they agitated her greatly. Now it happened when they agitated her, she ran 
from them, she came to the upper places of the Chaos. And the emanations of the 
Authades pursued her, they agitated her greatly. Now it happened after these 
things Adamas, the <I>Tyrant</I>, looked forth from the twelve aeons. He also 
was angry with the Pistis Sophia, because she wished to go to the Light of 
Lights which was above them all; because of this he was angry with her. Now it 
happened when Adamas, the <I>Tyrant</I>, looked forth from the twelve aeons, he 
saw the emanations of the Authades oppressing the Pistis Sophia until they took 
away all her light from her. But it happened when the power of the Adamas came 
down to the Chaos to the presence of all the emanations of the Authades - now it 
happened when that demon came down to the Chaos - he threw the Pistis Sophia 
down. And the lion-faced power and the serpent-face and the basilisk-face and 
the dragon-face and all the other emanations of the Authades, which were very 
numerous, surrounded the Pistis Sophia at one time, wishing to take her inner 
powers once again. And they oppressed <BR>the Pistis Sophia greatly, and they 
threatened her. Now it happened when they oppressed her and when they agitated 
her greatly, she cried again to the light and she sang praises, saying: 
<P>1."O Light, who hast helped me, may thy light come down upon me. 
<P>2. For thou art my shelter and I come to thee, O Light, believing in thee, O 
Light. 
<P>3. For thou art my Saviour from the emanations of the Authades and Adamas, 
the <I>Tyrant, </I>and it is thou who wilt save me from all his powerful 
threats." 
<P>However, when the Pistis Sophia had said these things, then again through the 
command of my Father, the First Mystery who looks within, I sent again Gabriel 
and Michael and the great outpouring of light, that they should help the Pistis 
Sophia. And I commanded Gabriel and Michael that they should carry the Pistis 
Sophia upon their hands, lest her feet touch the darkness below. And again I 
commanded them that they should guide her in the places of Chaos from whence 
they would bring her out. Now it happened when the angels went down to the 
Chaos, they and the outpouring of light, that it was exceedingly shining, there 
being no measure to the light which it had, they were afraid and they released 
the Pistis Sophia. And the great outpouring of light surrounded the Pistis 
Sophia on every side of her, on her left, and on her right, and on every side of 
her, and it made a crown of light for her head. Now it happened when the 
outpouring of light <BR>surrounded the Pistis Sophia, she took courage very 
greatly. And it (the outpouring) did not cease surrounding her on very side. And 
she was not afraid of the emanations of the Authades , which were in the Chaos. 
Nor again was she afaid of the other new power of the Authades which he had cast 
down into the Chaos like a flying arrow. Nor did she tremble at the demonic 
power of Adamas which came forth from the aeons. And again through my command, 
I, the First Mystery who look forth, my outpouring of light which surrounded the 
Pistis Sophia on all sides gave light exceedingly. And the Pistis Sophia 
remained in the midst of the light, while a great light was on her left and on 
her right and on all sides, and it was a crown upon her head. And all the 
emanations of the Authades were not able to change their faces again, nor were 
they able to bear the impact of the great light of my outpouring which was a 
crown of light for her head. And all the emanations of the Authades, a multitude 
of them fell at her right because she was greatly lighted, and another multitude 
fell at her left; and they were not able to approach the Pistis Sophia at all 
because of&nbsp; the great light. Rather they all fell upon one another or they 
all came close to one another. And they were not able to do any evil to the 
Pistis Sophia, because she trusted in the light. And through the command of my 
Father, the First Mystery who looks within, I also came down to the Chaos 
shining exceedingly.I made my way to the lion-faced power which was shining 
greatly, and I took away all its light <BR>from within it. And I restrained all 
the emanations of the Authades so that from this hour they did not go to their 
place, namely the Thirteenth Aeon. And I took the power from all the emanations 
of the Authades, and they all fell powerless into the Chaos. And I brought the 
Pistis Sophia forth on the right of Gabriel and Michael. And the great 
outpouring of light <BR>went again into her. And the Pistis Sophia saw with her 
eyes her enemies, that I had taken their light-power from them. And I brought 
forth the Pistis Sophia from the Chaos,&nbsp; while she trampled on the 
emanation of the Authades with a serpent-face; and furthermore she trampled upon 
the emanation with a basilisk-face with seven heads ; and she trampled upon the 
power with a lion-face, and the dragon-face. I caused the Pistis Sophia to&nbsp; 
remain standing upon the emanation of the Authades. But the one with a 
basilisk-face and seven heads was stronger than them all in its evil. And I, the 
First Mystery, stood upon it. And I took away all the powers within it, I 
destroyed all its matter, so that from this hour no seed from it should arise." 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 67</FONT></B> 
<P>When, however, the First Mystery said these things to the disciples, he 
answered, saying: "Do you understand in what manner I speak with you?" James 
came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning the interpretation of the words 
which <BR>thou hast spoken, thy light-power prophesied about them, through David 
in the 90th psalm: 
<P>1."He that dwells in the help of the Highest will be under the shadow of the 
God of Heaven. <BR>2. He will say to the Lord : Thou art my shelter and my 
refuge, my God in whom I have trusted. <BR>3. For he will save me from the snare 
of the hunters and a powerful word. <BR>4. He will overshadow thee with his 
breast and under his wings thou will trust. His truth will surround thee like a 
shield. <BR>5. Thou shalt not fear from terror by night and from an arrow that 
flies by day. <BR>6. From anything which walks in darkness; from a demonic blow 
at midday. <BR>7. A thousand will fall at thy left and ten thousand at thy 
right, but they will not approach thee. <BR>8. Rather thou wilt observe them 
with thy eyes and see the reward of sinners. <BR>9. For thou, O Lord, art my 
hope ; thou hast set the Highest as thy refuge. <BR>10. No evil will approach 
thee, no scourge will enter thy dwelling. <BR>11. For he will command his angels 
concerning thee, that they guard thee in all thy ways. <BR>12. They will bear 
upon thee upon their hands lest thou strikest a stone with thy foot. <BR>13. 
Thou wilt thread upon the serpent and basilisk, and thou wilt trample upon the 
lion and dragon. <BR>14. Because he has trusted in me I will save him ; I will 
overshadow him because he has known my name. <BR>15. He will cry to me and I 
will hear him; I will be with him in his affliction, and I will save him and 
honour him. <BR>16. I will increase him with many days, I will teach him my 
salvation. 
<P>This, O Lord, is the interpretation which thou didst speak. Hear now that I 
speak openly. Now the word which thy power spoke through David : "He that dwells 
in the help of the Highest will be under the shadow of the God of heaven.": that 
is, when the Sophia trusted in the light, she was under the light of the 
outpouring of light which came from the height through thee. And the word which 
thy power spoke through David : " I will say to the Lord: Thou art my shelter 
and my refuge, my God in whom I have trusted." : that is, the word with which 
the Pistis Sophia sang praises : "O Light, I believe in thee, thou art my 
Saviour from the emanations of the Authades and Adamas, the <I>Tyrant</I>;&nbsp; 
and it is tho who wilt save me from their powerful threats.". And furthermore 
the word which thy power spoke through David : "He will overshadow thee under 
his breast, and under his wings thou wilt trust." that is, the Pistis Sophia was 
in the light of the outpouring of light which came forth from thee, and she 
continued to be encouraged by the light upon her left and her right, which are 
the <BR>wings of the outpouring of light. And the word&nbsp; which thy 
light-power prophesied through David: "Truth will surround thee like a shield.": 
that is the light of the outpouring of light which surrounded the Pistis Sophia 
on all sides like a shield. And the word which thy power spoke: "He shall not 
fear from terror by night.": that is, that the Pistis Sophia did not fear the 
terrors and disturbances which were contained in the Chaos which is the night. 
And the word which thy power spoke : "He shall not fear an arrow that flies by 
day": that is, that the Pistis Sophia did not fear the power which the Authades 
finally sent from the height, which came to the Chaos like an arrow which flies. 
Now thy light-power said : "Thou shalt not fear an arrow that flies by day" , 
because that power came forth from the tirteenth(<I>Schmidt suggests that this 
is an error in the manuscript and that it is supposed to be the Twelft</I>)<I> 
</I>aeon. He is lord over the twelft aeon and it is he who lights all the aeons 
; because of this he has said "the day". And the word which thy power spoke : 
"He will not fear anything which walks in the darkness.": that is, the Pistis 
Sophia did not fear the emanationn with a serpent-face, which causes fear to the 
Pistis Sophia in the Chaos which is the darkness. And the word which thy power 
said : " He shall not fear a demonic blow at midday.": that is the Pistis Sophia 
did not fear the demonic emanation of Adamas the <I>Tyrant</I>, which cast the 
Pistis Sophia down with a great blow, which came forth from Adamas from the 
twelft aeon. Because of this thy <BR>power said: "He shall not fear a demonic 
blow at midday." "Midday", because it came from the twelfth aeon, which is the 
hour of midday. And furthermore "Night" because it came forth from the Chaos, 
which is the night, and it came forth from the twelfth aeon, which is the middle 
between the two. Because of this thy light-power said "the hour of midday", 
because the twelve aeons are in the middle between the thirteenth aeon and the 
Chaos. And the word which thy light-power spoke through David: " A thousand will 
fall at his left and ten thousand at his right, and they will not approach 
him.": that is, when the emanations of the Authades which were very numerous 
were not able to bear the great light of the outpouring of light, a multitude of 
them fell at the left of the Pistis Sophia and a multitude fell at her right. 
And they were not able&nbsp; to approach her to corrupt her. And the word which 
thy light-power spoke through David : "Rather thou wilt observe them with thine 
eyes and see the reward of sinners, for thou , O Lord, art my hope.":&nbsp; that 
is, the Pistis Sophia observed with her eyes her enemies, namely the emanations 
of the Authades which had all fallen upon one another. Not only did she observe 
them with her eyes, but thou also, my Lord, the First Mystery, thou didst take 
away the light-power which was in the lion-faced power ; and further thou didst 
take away the power of all the emanations of the Authades, and thou didst 
restrain them in that Chaos, that they should not go to their place from that 
hour. Now because of this, the Pistis Sophia observed with her eyes her enemies, 
namely the emanations of the Authades, in everything which David prophesied 
about the Pistis Sophia, saying : "Rather thou wilt observe them with thy eyes 
and see the reward of sinners.". Not only did she observe them with her eyes, 
that they fell against one another in the Chaos, but she also saw their reward 
with which they were rewarded. As the emanations of&nbsp; the Authades thought 
to take away the light of the Sophia from her, thou didst reward them and repay 
them. And thou didst take away the light-power which is in them, instead of the 
lights of the Sophia who believed in the light of the height. And as thy 
light-power said through David : " Thou hast set the Most High as thy refuge. No 
evil will able to approach thee, and no scourge will enter thy dwelling." : that 
is, when the Pistis Sophia believed in the light and was oppressed, she sang 
praises to it, and the emanations of the Authades were not able to do any evil 
to her, nor were they able to corrupt her, and they were not able to approach 
her at all. And the word which thy power said through David: "He will command 
his angels concerning thee, that they guard thee in all thy ways ; and they will 
bear thee upon their hands, lest thou strike a stone with thy foot.": that is 
furthermore the word : "Thou didst command Gabriel and Michael that they should 
guide the Sophia in all the places of the Chaos until they bring her up, and 
that they should raise her upon their hands, lest her feet touch the darkness 
below and those of the darkness below seize her." And the word which thy 
light-power spoke through David : "Thou wilt thread upon the serpent and 
basilisk, and thou wilt trample upon the lion and dragon. Because he has trusted 
in me, I will save him and I will overshadow him because he has known my name." 
: that is the word: "When the Pistis Sophia came to emerge from the Chaos, she 
trampled upon the emanations <BR>of the Authades. She trampled upon those with 
serpent-faces and upon those with basilisk-faces having seven heads. And she 
trampled upon the lion-faced power and that with a dragon-face, because she 
believed in the light she was saved from them all." This, my Lord, is the 
interpretation of the words which thou hast spoken." 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 68</FONT></B> 
<P>It happened when the First Mystery heard these words, he said: "Excellent, 
James,&nbsp; thou beloved one." The First Mystery continued again, however, with 
the discourse. He said to the disciples: " It happened when I brought the Pistis 
Sophia <BR>forth from the Chaos, she cried out again saying: 
<P>1."I have been saved from the Chaos and released from the bonds of darkness. 
I have come to thee, O Light. 
<P>2. For thou hast been light on every side of me as thou didst save and help 
me. 
<P>3. And the emanations of the Authades, as they rose against me, thou didst 
prevent them through thy light. And they were not able to approach me, because 
thy light was with me, and saving me through thy outpouring of light. 
<P>4. For because the emanations of the Authades oppressed me, they took away my 
power from me, they cast me into the Chaos there being no light in me. I became 
like matter which is heavy, before them. 
<P>5. And after these things an outpouring power came to me from thee, saving 
me; it gave light on my left and on my right, and it surrounded me on every 
side, so that no part of me was without light. 
<P>6. And thou hast clothed me with the light of thy outpouring. And thou hast 
purified from me all my materials because of thy light. 
<P>7. And thy outpouring of light is that which has raised me, and it has taken 
away from me the emenations of the Authades, which afflicted me. 
<P>8. And in thy light I became courageous and a pure light of thy outpouring. 
<P>9. And the emanations of the Authades which oppressed me have gone far from 
me, and I have become lighted in thy great power, fr thou dost save me at all 
times." 
<P>This is the repentance which the Pistis Sophia said when she came out of the 
Chaos and was released from the bonds of the Chaos. Now at this time, he who has 
ears to hear, let him hear." 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 69</FONT></B> 
<P>Now it happened when the First Mystery finished saying these words to the 
disciples, Thomas came forward and said: <BR>"My Lord, my man of light has ears 
and my mind has understood the words which thou hast said. Now at this time 
command me that I give the interpretation of the words clearly." But the First 
Mystery answered and said to Thomas: <BR>"I command thee to give the 
interpretation of the song of praise in which the Pistis Sophia sang praises to 
me." <BR>Thomas however answered and said : "My Lord, concerning the song of 
praise which the Pistis Sophia spoke because she was saved from the Chaos, thy 
light-power once prophesied about it through Solomon, the son of David, in his 
Odes, thus:" 
<P>1. I have been saved from the bonds; I have fled to thee, O Lord. <BR>2. For 
thou hast been a right hand to me ; saving me, saving me and helping me. <BR>3. 
Thou hast prevented those that rise against me; and they have not been revealed 
because thy face was with me, saving me with thy grace. <BR>4. I was despised in 
the presence of a multitude; and they cast me forth; I became like lead in their 
presence. <BR>5. There has been for me a power from thee, helping me; for thou 
hast placed lamps on my right side and on my left side, lest any side of me 
should be without light. <BR>6. Thou hast sheltered me with the shadow of thy 
mercy; and I became raised above garments of skin. <BR>7. It was thy right hand 
which raised me and thou hast taken away sickness from me. <BR>8. I have become 
powerful in thy truth and purified in righteousness. <BR>9. Those that rose 
against me have gone far from me; and I have been justified in thy beneficence, 
for thy rest exists for ever and ever." 
<P>Now, O my Lord, this is the interpretation of the repentance which the Pistis 
Sophia spoke when she was saved from the Chaos. Hear now and I will say it 
openly. 
<P>Now the word which thy light-power spoke through Solomon: " I have been saved 
from my bonds; I have fled to thee , O Lord": that is the word which the Pistis 
Sophia spoke; "I have been released from the bonds of darkness; I have come to 
thee, O Light". And the word which thy power spoke: "Thou hast been a right hand 
to me; saving me and helping me." And the word which thy light-power spoke: 
"Thou hast prevented those that rise against me and they have not been 
revealed.": that is the word which the Pistis Sophia said: "And the emanations 
of the Authades, which rose against me, thou didst prevent them through thy 
light ; and they were not able to approach me." And the word which thy power 
spoke: "For thy face was with me, saving me with thy grace": that is the word 
which the Pistis Sophia said : "Because thy light was with me , saving me 
through thy outpouring of light." And the word which thy power spoke : " I was 
despised in the presence of a multitude and they cast me forth." that is the 
word which Pistis Sophia said: "For the emanations of the Authades oppressed me 
and they took away my power from me ; and I was despised before them and they 
cast me into the Chaos, there being no light in me."&nbsp; And the word which 
thy power spoke: " I became like lead in their presence": that is the word which 
the Pistis Sophia said: "When they took away my lights from me I became like 
matter (<I>hylè</I>) which was heavy, before them." And the word which thy power 
spoke: "There has been for me a power from thee, helping me.": that is the word 
which the PIstis Sophia said; "And after these things a light-power came to me 
from thee, saving me". And the word which thy power spoke: " Thou hast palced 
lamps on my right side and on my left side, lest any side of me should be 
without light.": that is the word which the Pistis Sophia said: "Thy power gave 
light on my right and my left, and It surrounded me on every side of me, so that 
no part of me was without light.". And the word which thy power spoke: "Thou 
hast sheltered me in the shadow of thy mercy": that is the word which the Pistis 
Sophia said: "And thou hast clothed me with the light of thy outpouring". And 
the word which thy power spoke: "I became raised above garments of skin"; that 
is the word which the Pistis Sophia said: "I have been purified from all my evil 
materials, and I have become raised over them in thy light." And the word which 
thy power spoke through Solomon: "It was thy right hand which raised me and it 
took away sickness from me": that is the word which the Pistis Sophia said: " 
And thy outpouring of light is that which has raised me in thy light, and it has 
taken away from me the emanations of the Authades which afflicted me". And the 
word which thy power spoke: "I have become powerful in thy truth and purified in 
thy righteousness": that is the word which the Pistis Sophia said: " And in thy 
light I became powerful and a pure light in thy outpouring".&nbsp; And the word 
which thy power spoke: "Those that rose against me have gone far from me.": that 
is the word which the PIstis Sophia said: " And the emanations&nbsp; of the 
Authades which oppressed me have gone far from me". And the word which thy 
light-power spoke through Solomon: "And I have been justified in thy benefience, 
for thy rest exists for ever and ever": that is the word which the Pistis Sophia 
said: "I have been saved in thy benefience, for thou dost save everyone." 
<P>Now, O my Lord, this is the whole interpretation of the repentance which the 
Pistis Sophia spoke when she was saved from the Chaos, and she was released from 
the bonds of darkness. 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 70</FONT></B> 
<P>Now it happened when the First Mystery heard Thomas saying these words, he 
said to him: "Excellent, well done Thomas, thou blessed one. This is the 
interpretation of the song of praise which the Pistis Sophia spoke." 
<P>The First Mystery, however, continued again. He said to the disciples: "But 
the Pistis Sophia continyed again, she sang praises to me, saying: 
<P>1. I sing praise to thee; through thy ordinance thou didst bring me forth 
from the aeon on high, which is above, and thou didst bring me to the places 
below. <BR>2. And again through thy ordinance thou didst save me from the places 
below; and through thyself thou hast there taken the matter which is my 
light-power, and I saw it. <BR>3. And thou hast dispelled from me the emantions 
of the Authades which oppressed me, and they were hostile to me; and thou didst 
give to me the authority that I should be released from the bonds of the 
emanations of the Adamas. <BR>4. And thou hast smitten the basilisk with seven 
heads,&nbsp; thou hast cast it out with my hands; and trhou has set me up over 
its matter. Thou hast destroyed it, lest its seed rise up from this hour. <BR>5. 
And thou wast with me giving power to me in all these things; and thy light 
surrounded me in all places, and through thyself thou hast made all the 
emanations of the Authades powerless. <BR>6. For thou hast taken away from them 
the power of their light; and thou hast made straight my way to bring me forth 
from the Chaos. <BR>7. And thou hast removed me out of the material darknesses 
and thou hast taken away from them all my powers, the light which had been 
taken. <BR>8. Thou hast cast into them (my powers) pure light; and to all my 
members, in which there was no light, thou hast given pure light out of the 
light of the height. <BR>9. And thou hast made straight the way for them (my 
members); and the light of thy face has become for me imperishable life. <BR>10. 
Thou hast brought me above the Chaos, the place of the Chaos and the 
destruction, so that all the materials within it which are in that place should 
be released, so that all my powers should be renewed in thy light and that 
thy&nbsp; light should be within them all. <BR>11. Thou hast placed the light of 
thy outpouring in me. I have become purified light. This again is the second 
song of praise which the Pistis Sophia spoke. Now let him who understands this 
repentance come forth and say it." 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 71</FONT></B> 
<P>Now it happened when the First Mystery finished saying these words, Matthew 
came forward and said: " I have understood the interpretation&nbsp; of the song 
of praise which the Pistis Sophia spoke. Now at this time command me that I say 
it openly." 
<P>The First Mystery, however, answered and said: "I command thee, Matthew, to 
give the interpretation of the song of <BR>praise which the Pistis Sophia 
spoke." 
<P>Matthew, however, answered and said: Concerning the interpretation of the 
song of praise which the Pistis Sophia spoke, <BR>thy light-power once 
prophesied about it through the Ode of Solomon, thus: 
<P>1. He who brought me down from the high places which are above has brought me 
up from the places in the depth below. <BR>2. He who there has taken those that 
are in the midst has taught me of them. <BR>3. He who has dispelled my enemies 
and my adversaries has given me authority over bonds, to release them. <BR>4. He 
who has smitten the serpent with seven heads with my hands has set me up over 
its root, so that I might wipe out its seed. <BR>5. And thou wast with me, 
helpingt me. In all places thy name surrounded me. <BR>6. Thy right hand has 
destroyed the poison of the slanderer (lit. Satanas); thy hand has made th way 
for thy faithful ones. <BR>7. Thou hast freed them from the graves and thou hast 
removed them from the midst of corpses. <BR>8. Thou hast taken the dead bones 
and thou hast clothed them with a body; and to those that do not move thou hast 
given energy of life. <BR>9. Thy way has become indestructible, and thy face. 
<BR>10. Thou hast brought thy aeon to destruction that all things should be 
dissolved and be made new and that thy light should become a foundation for them 
all. <BR>11. Thou hast built thy wealth upon them, and they have become a holy 
dwelling place. 
<P>This now, my Lord, is&nbsp; the interpretation of the song of praise which 
the Pistis Sophia spoke. Hear now that I say it openly. The word which thy power 
spoke through Solomon: "He who brought me down from the high places which are 
above also brought me forth from the places in the depth below.": that is the 
word which the Pistis Sophia said: "I sing praise to thee; through thy 
ordinance&nbsp; thou didst bring me forth from the aeon on high which is above, 
and thou didst bring me t the places below. And again through thy ordinance thou 
didst save me and bring me out of the places below." And the word which thy 
power spoke through Solomon: " He who there has taken those that are in the 
midst has taught me of them": that is the word which the Pistis Sophia said: " 
And again through thyself thou hast caused the matter in the midst of <BR>my 
power to be purified, and I saw it". And again the word which thy power spoke 
through Solomon: "He who has dispelled my enemies and my adversaries" : that is 
the word which the Pistis sophia said: " And thou hast dispelled from me the 
emantions of the Authades which oppressed me, and were hostile to me". And the 
word which thy power said: "He who gave to me his wisdom over bonds, to release 
them.": that is the word which the Pistis Sophia said : " And he gave me his 
wisdom to release me from the bonds of those emanations." And the word which thy 
power spoke: "He who has smitten the serpent with my hands, has set me up over 
its matter. Thou hast destroyed it that its seed may not rise up from this 
hour". And the word which thy power spoke: " And thou wast to me helping me": 
that is the word which the Pistis Sophia said: "And thou was with me giving 
power to me in al these things.". And the word which thy power spoke: "In all 
places thy name surrounded me" : that is the word which the Pistis Sophia said: 
"And thy light surrounded me in all their places." And the word which thy power 
spoke: "Thy right hand has destroyed the poison of the slanderer": that is the 
word which the Pistis Sophia said: "And through thyself the emanations of the 
Authades were made powerless. For thou hast taken away from them the light of 
their power.". And the word which thy power spoke: " Thy hand has made the way 
for thy faithful ones": that is the word which the Pistis Sophia spoke: "Thou 
hast made straight my way, to bring me forth from the Chaos because I have 
believed in thee". And the word which thy power spoke: " Thou hast freed them 
from the graves and hast removed them from the midst of the corpses.": that is 
the word which the Pistis Sophia said: " And thou hast freed me from the Chaos 
and thou hast removed me out of the material darknesses which are the dark 
emanations in the Chaos, the light of which thou hast taken away from them." And 
the word which thy power spoke: " Thou hast <BR>taken dead bones and thou hast 
clothed them with a body; and to those that do not move thou hast given energy 
of life": that is the word which the Pistis Sophia spoke: "Thou hast taken all 
my powers in which there was no light, thou hast put into them pure light. And 
to all my members in which no light moved, thou hast given living light from thy 
height." And the word which thy power spoke: "Thy way has become indestructible, 
and thy face." : that is the word which the Pistis Sophia said: " And thou hast 
made straight thy way for me, and the light of thy face has become for me 
imperishable life." <BR>And the word which thy power spoke: " Thou hast brought 
thy aeon&nbsp; to destruction, that all things should be dissolved and made 
new.":&nbsp; that is the word which the Pistis Sophia said: "Thou hast brought 
me, thy power, above the Chaos and above the destruction, so that all the 
materials which are in that place should be dissolved, and that all my powers 
should <BR>be renewed in the light."&nbsp; And the word which thy power spoke: 
"And thy light becomes a foundation for them all": that is the word which the 
Pistis Sophia said: " And thy light has been in them all". And the word which 
thy light-power which thy light-power spoke through Solomon: "Thou hast placed 
thy wealth upon it, and it has become a holy dwelling place": that is the word 
which the Pistis Sophia said: " Thou hast made fast the light of thy outpouring 
upon me, and I have become purified light." This now, my Lord, is the 
interpretation of the song of praise which the Pistis Sophia said." 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 72</FONT></B> 
<P>Now it happened whan the First Mystery heard these words which Matthew spoke, 
he said: "Excellent, Matthew, and well done, thou beloved one. This is the 
interpretation of the song of praise which the Pistis Sophia spoke." 
<P>The First Mystery however continued again, he said: "The Pistis Sophia, 
however, continued again in this song of praise, <BR>she said: 
<P>1. I will say that thou art the light which is on high, for thou didst save 
me, and thou hast brought me to thyself. And thou didst not allow the emanations 
of the Authades, which are my enemies, to take away my light. 
<P>2. O Light of Lights, I have sung praises to thee; thou hast saved me. <BR>3. 
O Light, thou hast brought my power up from the Chaos, thou hast saved me from 
among those that go down to the darkness. 
<P>The Pistis Sophia said these words also. Now at this time, he whose mind has 
become understanding to understand the words which the Pistis Sophia spoke, let 
him come forward and give their interpretation" 
<P>Now it happened when the First Mystery finished saying these words to the 
discipls, Mary came forward. She said: "My Lord, my mind is understanding at all 
times that I should come forward at any time and give the interpretation of the 
words which she spoke, but I am afraid of Peter, for he threatens me and he 
hates our race." 
<P>But when she said these things, the First Mystery said to her: "Everyone who 
will be filled with the Spirit of light to come forward and give the 
interpretation of those things which I say, him will no one be able to prevent. 
Now at this time, O Maria, give the interpretation of the words which the Pistis 
Sophia said." 
<P>Now Maria answered and said to the First Mystery in the midst of the 
disciples: "My Lord, concerning the interpretation of the words which the Pistis 
Sophia spoke, thy light-power once prophesied through David thus: 
<OL>
  <LI>I will exalt thee, O Lord, for thou hast received me and thou hast not 
  given to my enemies to rejoice over me. <BR>2. O Lord, my God, I have cried to 
  thee and thou didst heal me. <BR>3. O Lord thou hast brought my soul up from 
  Amente; thou hast saved me from those who go down to the pit."</LI></OL><B><FONT 
size=+1>Chapter 73</FONT></B> 
<P>However, when Maria had said these things, the First Mystery said to her: 
"Excellent, well done, Maria, thou blessed one." 
<P>But he continued again with the discourse. He said to the disciples: " The 
Pistis Sophia continued again with this song of praise, she said: 
<P>1. The Light has become my Saviour. <BR>2. And it has turned my darkness into 
light for me. And it has rent the Chaos which surrounded me. It has girded me 
with light." 
<P>Now it happened when the First Mystery finished speaking these words, Martha 
came forward and said: "My Lord, thy power prophesied once, through David, 
concerning these words, saying: 
<P>10. The Lord has become my helper. <BR>11. He has turned my lament into 
rejoicing for me, he has rent my sackcloth, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
he has girded me with gladness." 
<P>It happened, however, when the First Mystery finished hering these words 
which Martha spoke, he said: "Excellent, and well done, Martha" 
<P>But the First Mystery continued again, he said to the disciples: "The Pistis 
Sophia continued again with the song of praise, and she said: 
<P>1. My Power, sing praise to the Light and forget not all the powers of the 
light which he has given to thee. <BR>2. And all the powers within me, sing 
praise to the name of his holy mystery. <BR>3. Who forgives all thy 
transgressions, who saves thee from all thy oppressions with which the 
emanations of the Authades have afflicted thee. <BR>4. Who has saved thy light 
from the emanations of the Authades which belong to destruction; who has crowned 
thee with light in his compassion until he saves thee. <BR>5. Who has filled 
thee with pure light; and thy beginning will be renewed like an invisible one of 
the height. 
<P>With these words the Pistis Sophia sang praises because she was saved. And 
she remembered all the things which I had done for her." 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 74</FONT></B> 
<P>Now it happened when the First Mystery finished saying these words to the 
disciples, he said to them: " He who understands the interpretation of these 
words, let him come forward and speak openly." 
<P>Maria came forward again and said: " My Lord, concerning these words with 
which the Pistis Sophia sang praises, <BR>thy light-power prophesied them 
through David, thus; 
<P>1. Bless the Lord, my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 
<BR>2. Bless the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his rewards. <BR>3. Who 
forgives all thy iniquities and who heals all thy sicknesses. <BR>4. Who saves 
thy life from destruction, who crowns thee with mercy and compassion. <BR>5. Who 
satisfies thy desire with good things; thy youth will be renewed like that of an 
eagle." 
<P>Now it happened when the First Mystery heard these words which Maria spoke, 
he said: "Excellent, O Maria, thou blessed one." 
<P>Now it happened after these things, the First Mystery continued again with 
the discourse, he&nbsp; said to the disciples: " I took the Pistis Sophia. I 
brought her out to a place which is below the thirteenth aeon. And I gave to her 
a new mystery of the light, which is not that of her own aon, the place of the 
invisible ones. And I gave to her a song of praise of the light so that from 
this time the archons of the aeons would not be able to have power over her. And 
I set her in that place until I should come for her and take her to her place 
which is in the height. 
<P>Now it happened when I set her in that place, she spoke again this song of 
praise, <BR>saying thus: 
<P>1. In faith I have believed in the Light; and he remembered me, he heard my 
song of praise. <BR>2. He brought my power out of the Chaos of all the matter, 
and the darkness below. And he brought me out, he placed me in an aeon on high 
which is strong; he has set me on the way which leads to my place. <BR>3. And he 
gave me a new mystery which is not that of my aeon; and he gave me a song of 
praise of the light. Now at this time, O Light, all the archons of the light 
will see what thou hast done for me, and they wil be afraid, and they will 
believe in thy light. 
<P>Now the Pistis Sophia spoke this song of praise, rejoicing because she was 
brought out of the Chaos, and she was brought to the places which are below the 
thirteenth aeon. 
<P>Now at this time, he whose mind moves him to understand the interpretation of 
the thought in the song of praise which the Pistis Sophia spoke, let him come 
forward and say it." 
<P>Andrew came forward, he said: "My Lord, this is what thy light-power once 
prophesied through David, saying: 
<P>1. I waited with endurance for the Lord; he gave heed to me and he heard my 
supplication. <BR>2. He brought my soul up from the pit of wretchedness and the 
miry clay; he has set my feet upon a rock and he has directed my steps. <BR>3. 
He has put a new song into my mouth, a blessing for our God. Many will see and 
will be afraid, and will hope in the Lord." 
<P>Now it happeend when Andrew gave the thought of the Pistis Sophia, the First 
Mystery said to him: "Excellent, Andrew, thou blessed one." 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 75</FONT></B> 
<P>However he (the First Mystery) continued again with the discourse. He said to 
the disciples: "These are all the events which happened to the Pistis Sophia. 
Now it happened when I brought her to the place which is below the thirteenth 
aeon, I was about to go to the light and to abandon her, she said to me: "O 
Light of Lights, thou wilt go to the light and abandon me, and Adamas, the 
Tyrant, will know that thou hast abandoned me, and he will know that there is no 
one who will save me. He will come again to me to this place, he and all his 
archons who hate me. And the Authades will again give <BR>power to his 
lion-faced emanation, that they all come and oppress me at the same time and 
take away all my light from me, so that I become powerless, and I also become 
without light. Now at this time, O Light and my Light, take the power of the 
light from me, so that I become powerless, take the power of their light from 
them, so that they have not the power to oppress me from this time." 
<P>Now it happened when I heard these words which the Pistis Sophia said, I 
answered her, saying; "My Father who emanated me has not yet commanded me to 
take away their light from them, but I will seal the places of the Authades, 
<BR>and all his aeons which hate thee, because thou hast believed in the light. 
And furthermore I will seal the places of Adamas and his archons, so that none 
of them are able to wage war on thee until their time is completed, and until 
the appointed time comes fwhen my Father commands me to take away their light 
from them." 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 76</FONT></B> 
<P>But after this I said to her again: " Hear that I speak with thee about their 
time, in which these things will happen which I have said to thee. They will 
happen when the three times are completed." 
<P>The Pistis Sophia answered, she said to me: "O Light, by what shall I known 
when the three times will happen, that I may rejoice and be glad, because the 
time has arrived that thou takest me to my place? And furthermore I will rejoice 
because the time has come that thou wilt take away the light-power from all 
those that hate me because I have believed in thy light." 
<P>However, I answered again and said to her: "When thou seest the gate of the 
Treasury of the great Light - this which opens to the thirteenth aeon, namely 
the left - when that gate is opened the three times are completed." 
<P>The Pistis Sophia answered again, she said: "O Light, by what shall I know, 
when I am in this place, that gate has been opened?" 
<P>But I answered her and said to her: "When the gate is opened, those who are 
in all the aeons will know, because of the <BR>great light which will happen in 
all their places. Nevertheless see, I have now established that they (the 
archons) will not dare anything evil against thee, until the three times are 
completed. But thou wilt have the authority there to go to their <BR>twelve 
aeons at the same time which pleases thee, and to return again, and to come to 
thy place in which thou art this time, which is below the thirteenth aeon. But 
thou wilt not have authority to go within the gate of the height which is in the 
<BR>thirteenth aeon, to go within to thy place from which thou didst come forth. 
Nevertheless, when the three times are now completed, the Authades and all his 
archons will oppress thee again to take away thy light from thee. He will be 
angry with thee, thinking that&nbsp; thou hast restrained his power in the 
Chaos, and thinking that thou hast taken away the light (of his power) from it. 
He will now be infuriated against thee to take away thy light from thee, so that 
he may send it down to the Chaos and put it into those emanations of his, so 
that they should have power to come out of the Chaos, and to come to his (the 
Authades) place. But Adamas will begin these things. But I will take away all 
thy powers from him and give them to thee, and I will come and take them. Now at 
the moment when they oppress thee at that time, sing praises to the light and I 
will not delay to help thee. And I will come to thee in haste to the places 
below thee. And I will come to this place <BR>in which I have established thee, 
which is below the thirteenth aeon, until I take thee to thy place from which 
thou didst come forth". 
<P>Now it happened when the Pistis Sophia heard these words which I spoke to 
her, she rejoiced with great joy. But I sent her in the place which is below the 
thirteenth aeon, I went to the light, I abandoned her. 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 77</FONT></B> 
<P>The First Mystery however spoke to the disciples of all these events, for 
they happened to the Pistis Sophia. And he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, 
speaking all these words in the midst of the disciples. He continued again 
however, he said to them: "But it happened again after all these things, as I 
was in the world of mankind, as I was sitting by the wayside that is this place, 
namely the&nbsp; Mount of Olives, before I had yet been sent my garment - which 
I had left behind in the 24th mystery from within, but the first from without, 
which is the great incomprehensible one in which I shone - and before I went to 
the height to receive my second garment, as I was sitting before you in this 
place which is the Mount of Olives,&nbsp; the time was completed of which I had 
spoken to the Pistis Sophia thus: "Adamas and all his archons will oppress 
thee." 
<P>Now it happened when that time came - I however was in the world of mankind, 
sitting before you in this place which is the Mount of Olives - Adamas looked 
forth from the twelve Aeons. He looked down to the places of the Chaos, he saw 
his demonic power which was in the Chaos with no light at all in it, for I had 
taken away its light from it. And he saw it, that it was dark and not able to 
come to his place, namely the twelve aeons. Adamas again remembered Pistis 
Sophia and he was exceedingly angry with her,&nbsp; for he thought that it was 
she who had restraned his power in the Chaos, and he thought that it was she who 
had taken away its light from it (the power of Adamas). And he was very wrathful 
and added anger to anger. He emanated forth a dark emanation and another chaotic 
and wicked one which was powerful, so that through them he should agitate the 
Pistis Sophia. And he created a dark place in his place, so that he should 
oppress the Sophia within it. And he took many of his archons, they pursued the 
Pistis Sophia to bring her to the dark Chaos which he had created. And the two 
dark emanations which Adamas had emanated oppressed her in that place, and they 
agitated <BR>her until they took away all her light from her. And Adamas took 
the light of the Pistis Sophia , and he gave it to the two dark and powerful 
emanations to take to the great Chaos which is chaotic, so that perhaps it (the 
power) would be able to come to his place, for it had become very dark because I 
had taken away its light-power from it. Now it happened when they pursued the 
Pistis Sophia, she cried out again, she sang praises to the light since I had 
said to her: "When thou art oppressed and dost praise me, I will come in haste 
to help thee." 
<P>Now it happened when she was oppressed - but I sat before you in this place 
which is the Mount of Olives - she sang praises to the light, saying: 
<P>1. O Light of Lights, I have believed in thee. Save me from all these archons 
which pursue me, and help me. <BR>2. Lest they take away my light from me, like 
the lion-faced power, for thy light and thy outpouring are not with me to save 
me. Rather Adamas was angry with me, saying to me: It is thou who hast 
restrained my power in the Chaos. <BR>3. Now O Light of Lights, If I have done 
this - If I have restrained it, If I have done anything unjust to that power. 
<BR>4. If I have oppressed it as it has oppressed me - may all these archons 
which pursue me take my light from me and leave me empty. <BR>5. And may the 
enemy Adamas pursue my power and seize it and take away my light&nbsp; from me, 
and cast it into his dark power which is in the Chaos; and&nbsp; may he place my 
power in the Chaos. <BR>6. Now O Light, seize me in thy anger, and raise thy 
power against my enemies which has risen against me at last. <BR>7. Save me 
quickly, according to what thou hast said: "I will help thee.". 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 78</FONT></B> 
<P>Now it happened when the First Mystery finished saying these words to the 
disciples, he said: "He who has understood these words which I have said, let 
him come forward and give their explanation." 
<P>James came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning this song of praise which 
the Pistis Sophia has sung, thy light-power once prophesied it, through David, 
in the 7th Psalm, thus: 
<P>1. O Lord my God, I have trusted thee; save me from those that pursue me, and 
deliver me. <BR>2. Lest he seize my soul like a lion; while there is no one who 
delivers and saves. <BR>3. O Lord my God, If I have done this; if there is 
injustice at my hands; <BR>4. If I have repaid those who repaid me with evil 
things, may I fall down empty through my enemies. <BR>5. And may the enemy 
pursue my soul and seize it, and trample my life upon the earth, and take my 
glory to be in the dust. <BR>6. Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath, be exalted in the 
boundary of my enemies. Arise in the commandment which thou hast decreed." 
<P>Now it happened when the First Mystery heard these words which James spoke, 
he said: "Excellent, James, thou beloved one." 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 79</FONT></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>However, the First Mystery continued, he said to the disciples: " Now it 
happened when the Pistis Sophia finished saying the words of this song of 
praise, she turned back to see whether the Adamas and his archons had turned 
back to go to their aeon. And she saw them as they were pursuing her. She turned 
to them and said to them: 
<P>1. Why do you pursue me and say: there is no one to be a help to me, to save 
me from you? <BR>2.&nbsp; Now at this time the light is a true judge and a 
strong one. But he is long-suffering until the time of which he has spoken to me 
thus: I will come and help thee; and he will not bring his wrath upon you at all 
times. And this is the time of which he has spoken to me. <BR>3.&nbsp; Now at 
this time, if you do not turn yourselves back and cease to pursue me, the light 
will prepare his power, and he will prepare with all his powers. <BR>4.&nbsp; 
And he has prepared with his power, that he may take away your light which is 
within you, so that you become dark; and he has created his powers, that he may 
take away your power from you and you be destroyed." 
<P>But when the Pistis Sophia had said these things, she looked to the place of 
Adamas. She saw the dark and chaotic place which had created. And she saw 
furthermore the dark emanations, of exceeding strenght, which Adamas had 
emanated, so that they should seize the Pistis Sophia and should cast her down 
to the Chaos which he had created, and should oppress her in that place, and 
should agitate her until they took her light away from her. 
<P>Now it happened when the Pistis Sophia saw those two dark emanations&nbsp; 
and the dark place which Adamas had created, she was afraid and she cried out to 
the light, saying: 
<P>1. O Light, behold Adamas the violent is angry. He has created a dark 
emanation, and furthermore he has emanated another chaotic one. <BR>2. And he 
has created another dark and chaotic one; and he has prepared it. <BR>3. Now at 
this time O Light, the Chaos which he has created so that he should cast me into 
it and take away my light-power from me - take away his light from him. <BR>4. 
And the thought which he conceived to take away my light, let his be (taken) 
from him. And the violence which he has spoken, to take away my lights from me - 
take away all his lights. 
<P>These are the words which the Pistis Sophia spoke in her song of praise. Now 
at this time he who is sober in spirit, let him come forward and give the 
interpretation of the words (which the Pistis Sophia spoke) in her song of 
praise." 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 80</FONT></B> 
<P>Martha came forward again and said: "My Lord, I am sober in spirit, and I 
understand these words which thou dost speak. Now at this time command me that I 
give their interpretation openly." 
<P>The First Mystery , however, answered and said to Martha: " I command thee, 
Martha, that thou givest the interpretation of the words which the Sophia said 
in her song of praise." 
<P>Martha, however, answered and said: "My Lord, these are the words which thy 
light-power once prophesied through <BR>David in the 7th Psalm: 
<P>11. God is a righteous judge, and strong and long-suffering, who does not 
bring down his wrath every day. <BR>12.&nbsp; If you do not turn round he will 
sharpen his sword; he has bent his bow and made it ready. <BR>13. He has 
prepared in it instruments of death; he has made his arrows for those who will 
be burnt. <BR>14. Behold, violence has travailed; he has conceived trouble, he 
has given birth to iniquity. <BR>15. He has dug a pit, he has hollowed it; he 
will fall into the hole which he has made. <BR>16. His trouble will return upon 
his head and his violence will come down upon the crown of his head." 
<P>But when Martha had spoken these things, the First Mystery which looks forth 
said to her: "Excellent,m well done, Martha, thou blessed one." 
<P>&nbsp;<B><FONT size=+1>Chapter 81</FONT></B> 
<P>Now it happened when Jesus finished saying to his disciples all the events 
which had happened to the Pistis Sophia when <BR>she was in the Chaos, and the 
manner in which she had sung praises to the Light until he had saved her and 
brought her out of the Chaos, and brought her into the twelfth aeon, and the 
manner in which he had saved her from all her oppressions with which the archons 
of the Chaos had oppressed her, because she desired to go to the light, Jesus 
continued again with the discourse. He said to his disciples:" Now it happened 
after all these things, I took the Pistis Sophia, I brought her into the 
thirteenth aeon. And I was shining exceedingly , there being no measure&nbsp; to 
the light which I had. I came into the place of the 24 invisible ones and I was 
shining exceedingly.And they were agitated with great agitation. They looked and 
saw the Sophia who was with me. They recognised her, but as for me they did not 
recognise who I was. But they thought of me as being an emanation of the Land of 
the Light. Now it happened when the Sophia saw her fellow invisible ones she 
rejoiced with great joy and she was very glad. She wished to tell them the 
wonders which I had done for her on the earth of mankind below, until I saved 
her. She came&nbsp; to the midst of the invisible ones, she sang praises to me 
in their midst, saying: 
<P>1. I will give thanks to thee, O Light, for thou art a Saviour, 
and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thou art a deliverer at all times. <BR>2. I will 
speak this song of praise to the light, for he has saved me and he has delivered 
me out of the hands of the archons, my enemies. <BR>3. And thou hast saved me 
from all the places. And thou hast saved me from the height and the depth of the 
Chaos, and from the aeons of the archons, my enemies. <BR>4. And when I came 
forth from the height I went astray in places in which there was no light. And I 
was not able to return to the thirteenth aeon, my dwelling place. <BR>5. For 
there was no light in me, nor power. For my power had weakened completely. 
<BR>6. And the ligh saved me from all my afflictions. I saing praises tgo the 
light; he heard me when I was afflicted. <BR>7. He guided me in the creation of 
the aeons in order to bring me to the thirteenth aeon, my dwelling place. <BR>8. 
I will give thanks to thee, O Light, for thou hast saved me, and for thy wonders 
among the race of mankind. <BR>9. When I lacked my power thou didst give power 
to me ; and when I lacked my light thou didst fill me with purified light. 
<BR>10. I have been in the darkness and the shadow of the Chaos, bound with the 
strong bonds of the Chaos, and there was no light in me. <BR>11. I have caused 
wrath to the ordinance of light, I have transgressed; I have caused anger to the 
ordinance of the light, for I came forth from my place. <BR>12. And when I came 
down I lacked my power, and I was without light; and 0there was no one to help 
me. <BR>13. And when I was afflicted I sang praises to the light, and he saved 
me from my afflictions. <BR>14. And furthermore he broke all my bonds, he 
brought me out of the darkness and the oppressions of the Chaos. <BR>15. I will 
thank thee, O Light, for thou hast saved me; and thy wonders exist among the 
race of mankind. <BR>16. Thou hast broken the high gates of the darkness and the 
strong bars of the Chaos. <BR>17. And thou didsy cause me to turn away from the 
place in which I transgressed; and furthermore my power was taken because I 
transgressed. <BR>18. And I desisted from the mysteries; I went down to the 
gates of the Chaos. <BR>19. And when they afflicted me I sang praises to the 
light; he saved me from all my afflictions. <BR>20. Thou didst send thy 
outpouring&nbsp; of light; it gave power to me and it saved me from all my 
oppressions. <BR>21. I will thank thee, O Light, for thou hast saved me; and thy 
wonders are among the race of mankind." 
<P>Now this is the song of praise which the Pistis Sophia spoke as she was in 
the midst of the 24 invisible ones, wishing that they should know all the 
wonders which I had done for her. And she wished that they should know that I 
went to the world of mankind, I gave them the mysteries of the height. Now at 
this time, he who is elevated in his thought, let him come forward and say the 
interpretation of the song of praise which the Pistis Sophia spoke. "&nbsp;
