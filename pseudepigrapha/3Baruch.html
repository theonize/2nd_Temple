<P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">1 A narrative and revelation of Baruch, concerning 
those ineffable things which he saw by command of God. Bless Thou, O Lord.</P>
<P style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">2 A revelation of Baruch, who stood upon the river 
Gel weeping over the captivity of 3 Jerusalem, when also Abimelech was preserved 
by the hand of God, at the farm of Agrippa. And he was sitting thus at the 
beautiful gates, where the Holy of holies lay.</P>

Verily I Baruch was weeping in my mind and<B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </B>sorrowing<B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </B>on account of the people, and that 2 
Nebuchadnezzar the king was permitted by God to destroy His city, saying: Lord, 
why didst Thou set on fire Thy vineyard, and lay it waste? Why didst Thou do 
this? And why, Lord, didst Thou not requite us with another chastisement, but 
didst deliver us to nations such as these, so that they 3 reproach us and say, 
Where is their God? And behold as I was weeping and saying such things, I saw an 
angel of the Lord coming and saying to me: Understand, O man, greatly beloved, 
and trouble not thyself so greatly concerning the salvation of Jerusalem, for 
thus saith the Lord God, 4 the Almighty. For He sent me before thee, to make 
known and to show to thee all (the things) 5, 6 of God. For thy prayer was heard 
before Him, and entered into the ears of the Lord God. And when he had said 
these things to me, I was silent. And the angel said to me: Cease to provoke 7 
God, and I will show thee other mysteries, greater than these. And I Baruch 
said, As the Lord God liveth, if thou wilt show me, and I hear a word of thine, 
I will not continue to speak any longer. 8 God shall add to my judgement in the 
day of judgement, if I speak hereafter. And the angel of the powers said to me, 
Come, and I will show thee the mysteries of God.</P>

where the firmament has been set fast, and where there was a river which no one 
can cross, nor any strange breeze of all those which God created. And he took me 
and led me to the first heaven, and showed me a door of great size. And he said 
to me, Let us enter 3 through it, and we entered as though <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">borne </I>on wings, a distance of about 
thirty days' journey. And he showed me within the heaven a plain ; and there 
were men dwelling thereon, with the faces of 4 oxen, and the horns of stags and 
the feet of goats, and the haunches of lambs. And I Baruch asked the angel, Make 
known to me, I pray thee, what is the thickness of the heaven in which we 
journeyed, 5 or what is its extent, or what is the plain, in order that I may 
also tell the sons of men? And the angel whose name is Phamael said to me: This 
door which thou seest is the door of heaven, and as great as is the distance 
from earth to heaven, so great also is its thickness; and again as great as is 
<I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">the distance </I>(from North to South, so 
great) is the length of the plain which thou didst see. And again the angel of 
the powers said to me, Come, and I will show thee greater mysteries. But 6, 
7<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I said, I pray thee show me what 
are these men. And he said to me, These are they who built the tower of strife

took me and led me to a second heaven. And he showed me there 2 also a door like 
the first and said, Let us enter through it. And we entered, being borne on 
wings 3 a distance of about sixty days' journey. And he showed me there also a 
plain, and it was full of 4 men, whose appearance was like <I

I pray thee, Lord, say to me who are these. And he said, These are they who gave 
counsel to build the tower, for they whom thou seest drove forth multitudes of 
both men and women, to make bricks; among whom, a woman making bricks was not 
allowed to be released in the hour of child-birth, but brought forth while she 
was making bricks, and carried her child in her apron, and 6 continued to make 
bricks. And the Lord appeared to them and confused their speech, when they 7 had 
built the tower to <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">the height of </I>four 
hundred and sixty-three cubits. And they took a gimlet, and sought to pierce the 
heaven, saying, Let us see (whether) the heaven is made of clay, or of 8 brass, 
or of iron. When God saw this He did not permit them, but smote them with 
blindness and confusion of speech, and rendered them as thou 
seest.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></H1>

Lord, Thou didst show me great and wonderful things; and now 2 show me all 
things for the sake of the Lord. And the angel said to me, Come, let us proceed. 
(And I proceeded) with the angel from that place about one hundred and 
eighty-five days' 3 journey. And he showed me a plain and a serpent, which 
appeared to be two hundred plethra in length. 4 And he showed me Hades, and its 
appearance was dark and abominable. And I said, 5 Who is this dragon, and who is 
this monster around him? And the angel said, The dragon is he 6 who eats the 
bodies of those who spend their life wickedly, and he is nourished by them. And 
this is Hades, which itself also closely resembles him, in that it also drinks 
about a cubit from 7 the sea, which does not sink at all. Baruch said, And how 
(does this happen)? And the angel said, Hearken, the Lord God made three hundred 
and sixty rivers, of which the chief of 8 all are Alphias, Abyrus, and the 
Gericus; and because of these the sea does not sink. And I said, I pray thee 
show me which is the tree which led Adam astray. And the angel said to me, It is 
the vine, which the angel Sammael planted, whereat the Lord God was angry, and 
He cursed him and his plant, while also on this account He did not permit Adam 
to touch it, and therefore 9 the devil being envious deceived him through his 
vine. [And I Baruch said, Since also the vine has been the cause of such great 
evil, and is under judgment of the curse of God, and <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">was </I>the 10 destruction of the first 
created, how is it now so useful? And the angel said, Thou askest aright. When 
God caused the deluge upon earth, and destroyed all flesh, and four hundred and 
nine thousand giants, and the water rose fifteen cubits above the highest <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">mountains, then </I>the water entered into 
paradise and destroyed every flower; but it removed wholly without the bounds 
the shoot 11<B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </B>of the vine and cast it 
outside. And when the earth appeared out of the water, and Noah came out 12 of<B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </B>the ark, he began to plant of the 
plants which he found. But he found also the shoot of the vine; and he took it, 
and was reasoning in himself, What then is it? And I came and spake to 13<B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </B>him the things concerning it. And he 
said, Shall I plant it, or what <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">shall I 
do? </I>Since Adam was destroyed because of it, let me not also meet with the 
anger of God because of it. And saying 14<B 
style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> </B>these things he prayed that God would 
reveal to him what he should do concerning it. And when he had completed the 
prayer <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">which lasted </I>forty days, and 
having besought many things and wept, 15<B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> 
</B>he said: Lord, I entreat thee to reveal to me what I shall do concerning 
this plant. But God sent his angel Sarasael, and said to him, Arise, Noah, and 
plant the shoot of the vine, for thus saith the Lord : Its bitterness shall be 
changed into sweetness, and its curse shall become a blessing, and that which is 
produced from it shall become the blood of God; and as through it the human race 
obtained condemnation, <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">so </I>again 
through Jesus Christ the Immanuel will they receive in Him the 16 upward 
calling, and the entry into paradise]. Know therefore, 0 Baruch, that as Adam 
through this very tree obtained condemnation, and was divested of the glory of 
God, so also the men who now drink insatiably the wine which is begotten of it, 
transgress worse than Adam, and are far from the 17 glory of God, and are 
surrendering themselves to the eternal fire. For (no) good comes through it. For 
those who drink it to surfeit do these things: neither does a brother pity <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">his </I>brother, nor a father <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">his </I>son, nor children <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">their </I>parents, but from the drinking of 
wine come all <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">evils, </I>such as murders, 
adulteries, fornications, perjuries, thefts, and such like. And nothing good is 
established by it.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

four, under which burnt a fire, and in the chariot was sitting a man, wearing a 
crown of fire, (and) the chariot (was) drawn by forty angels. And behold a bird 
circling before the sun, about nine 3 cubits away. And I said to the angel, What 
is this bird? And he said to me, This is the 4, 5 guardian of the earth. And I 
said, Lord, how is he the guardian of the earth? Teach me. And the angel said to 
me, This bird flies alongside of the sun, and expanding his wings receives its 
fiery 6 rays. For if he were not receiving them, the human race would not be 
preserved, nor any other 7 living creature. But God appointed this bird <I

I saw on his right wing very large letters, <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">as large </I>as the space of a 
threshing-floor, the size of about four 8 thousand modii; and the letters were 
of gold. And the angel said to me, Read them. And I read 9 and they ran thus: 
Neither earth nor heaven bring me forth, but wings of fire bring me forth. And I 
said, Lord, what is this bird, and what is his name? And the angel said to 
me,<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>His name is called 11 Phoenix. 
(And I said), And what does he eat? And he said to me, The manna of heaven and 
12 the dew of earth. And I said, Does the bird excrete? And he said to me, He 
excretes a worm, and the excrement of the worm is cinnamon, which kings and 
princes use. But wait and thou shalt 13 see the glory of God. And while he was 
conversing <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">with me, </I>there was as a 
thunder-clap, and the place was shaken on which we were standing. And I asked 
the angel, My Lord, what is this sound? And the angel said to me, Even now the 
angels are opening the three hundred and sixty-five gates 14 of heaven, and the 
light is being separated from the darkness. And a voice came which said, Light 
15 giver, give to the world radiance. And when I heard the noise of the bird, I 
said, Lord, what is this 16 noise? And he said, This is <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">the bird </I>who awakens from slumber the 
cocks upon earth. For as men do through the mouth, so also does the cock signify 
to those in the world, in his own speech. For the sun is made ready by the 
angels, and the cock crows. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

said to me, The crown of the sun, when it has run through the day-four angels 
take it, and bear it up to heaven, and renew it, because it and its rays have 
been defiled upon earth; moreover it is so renewed each day. And I Baruch said, 
Lord, and wherefore 5 are its beams defiled upon earth? And the angel said to 
me, Because it beholds the lawlessness and unrighteousness of men, namely 
fornications, adulteries, thefts, extortions, idolatries, drunkenness, murders, 
strife, jealousies, evil-speakings, murmurings, whisperings, divinations, and 
such like, which are not well-pleasing to God. On account of these things is it 
defiled, and therefore is it renewed. 6 But <I

is exhausted. Because by restraining the rays of the sun through the fire and

no other. And at the transgression of the first Adam, it was near to Sammael

and God was 8 angry with it, and afflicted it, and shortened its days. And I 
said, And how does it not also shine always, but only in the night? And the 
angel said, Listen: as in the presence of a king, the courtiers cannot speak 
freely, so the moon and the stars cannot shine in the presence of the sun; for 
the stars are always suspended, but they are screened by the sun, and the moon, 
although it is uninjured, is consumed by the heat of the sun.

the angel took me and led me thence to a fifth heaven. And the gate was closed.

Kingdom of Heaven; but wait and thou shalt see 3<B

Michael, the commander <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">of the angels,

gates be opened. And they opened <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">them,

was with me came face to 7 face with him and said, Hail, my commander, and <I

Michael said, Hail thou also, our brother, and the interpreter of the 
revelations to those who pass through life 8 virtuously. And having saluted one 
another thus, they stood still. And I saw the commander Michael said, Hail thou 
also, our brother, and the interpreter of the revelations to those who pass 
through life 8 virtuously. And having saluted one another thus, they stood 
still. And I saw the commander Michael, holding an exceedingly great vessel; its 
depth <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">was as </I>great as <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">the distance </I>from heaven to 9<I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </I>earth, and its breadth as great as the 
<I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">distance </I>from north to south. And I 
said, Lord, what is that which Michael the archangel is holding? And he said to 
me, This is where the merits of the righteous enter, and such good works as they 
do, which are escorted before the heavenly God. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

And he said to me, These are angels (who) are over the 4, 5 righteous. And the

to me, These flowers are the merits of the righteous. And I saw other angels 
bearing baskets <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">which were </I>(neither) 
empty-nor full. And they began to lament, and did not venture to draw near, 7

exceedingly grieved, and the angel who was with me, because they did not fill 
the vessel.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

the enemy may not prevail to 3 the end; but say to me what ye ask. And they 
said, We pray thee, Michael our commander, transfer us from them, for we cannot 
abide with wicked and foolish men, for there is nothing good 4 in them, but 
every kind of unrighteousness and greed. For we do not behold them entering 
[into Church at all, nor among spiritual fathers, nor] into any good work. But 
where there is murder, there also are they in the midst, and where are 
fornications, adulteries, thefts, slanders, perjuries, jealousies, drunkenness, 
strife, envy, murmurings, whispering, idolatry, divination, and such like, 5
