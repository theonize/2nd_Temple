Introduction
The Book of Enoch (also 1 Enoch[1]) is an ancient Jewish religious work, ascribed to
Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. It is not regarded as scripture by Jews or any
Christian group, apart from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which to this day regards it
to be canonical.
Western scholars currently assert that its older sections (mainly in the Book of the
Watchers) date from about 300 BC and the latest part (Book of Parables) probably was
composed at the end of the 1st century BC.[2] However, Ethiopian scholars generally
hold that Ge'ez is the language of the original from which the Greek and Aramaic copies
were made, pointing out that it is the only language in which the complete text has yet
been found[3].
It is wholly extant only in the Ge'ez language, with Aramaic fragments from the Dead
Sea Scrolls and a few Greek and Latin fragments. There is no consensus among
Western scholars about the original language: some propose Aramaic, others Hebrew,
while the probable thesis according to E. Isaac is that 1 Enoch, as Daniel, was composed
partially in Aramaic and partially in Hebrew[4]:6.
A short section of 1 Enoch (1En1:9) is quoted in the New Testament (Letter of Jude
1:14-15), and there apparently attributed to "Enoch the Seventh from Adam" (1En60:8).
It is argued that all the writers of the New Testament were familiar with it and were
influenced by it in thought and diction.[5] The first part of Book of Enoch describes the
fall of the Watchers, the angels who fathered the Nephilim. The remainder of the book
describes Enoch's visits to Heaven in the form of travels, visions and dreams, and his
revelations.
The book consists of five quite distinct major sections (see each section for details):
The Book of the Watchers (1 Enoch 1 – 36)
The Book of Parables of Enoch (1 Enoch 37 – 71) (Also called the Similitudes of
Enoch)
The Astronomical Book (1 Enoch 72 – 82) (Also called the Book of the Heavenly
Luminaries or Book of Luminaries. )
The Book of Dream Visions (1 Enoch 83 – 90) (Also called the Book of Dreams)
The Epistle of Enoch (1 Enoch 91 – 108)
The shared view[6] is that these five sections were originally independent works (with
different dates of composition), themselves a product of much editorial arrangement,
and were only later redacted into what we now call 1 Enoch. This view is now opposed
only by a few authors who maintain the literary integrity of the Book of Enoch, one of
2
the most recent (1990) being the Ethiopian Wossenie Yifru[3]. Józef Milik has
suggested that the Book of Giants found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls should be part of
the collection, appearing after the Book of Watchers in place of the Book of Parables,
but for various reasons Milik's theory has not been widely accepted.
Canonicity in Judaism
Although evidently widely known at the time of the Development of the Jewish Bible
canon, 1Enoch was excluded from both the formal canon of the Tanakh and the typical
canon of the Septuagint and therefore also the writings known today as the
Apocrypha.[7] [8] One possible reason for Jewish rejection of the book might be the
textual nature of several early sections of the book which make use of material from the
Torah, for example 1En1 is a midrash of Deuteronomy 33. [9][10]. The content,
particularly detailed description of fallen angels, would also be a reason for rejection
from the Hebrew canon at this period - as illustrated by the comments of Trypho the
Jew when debating with Justin Martyr on this subject. Trypho: "The utterances of God
are holy, but your expositions are mere contrivances, as is plain from what has been
explained by you; nay, even blasphemies, for you assert that angels sinned and revolted
from God." (Dialogue 79) [11]

BOOK OF ENOCH
translation by M. Knibb of the Ethiopian text in the
S.O.A.S. Library at the University of London.
Section I. Chapters I-XXXVI
BOOK OF THE WATCHERS
1.1 These are the words of the
blessing of Enoch; according to which
he blessed the chosen and righteous
who must be present on the day of
distress, which is appointed, for the
removal of all the wicked and impious.
1.2 And Enoch began his story and said:
-
There was a righteous man whose eyes
were opened by the Lord, and he saw a
Holy vision in the Heavens, which the
Angels showed to me. And I heard
everything from them, and I understood
what I saw: but not for this generation,
but for a distant generation that will
come.
1.3 Concerning the Chosen I spoke; and
I uttered a parable concerning them:
The Holy and Great One will come out
of his dwelling.
1.4 And the Eternal God will tread from
there upon Mount Sinai, and he will
appear with his Host, and will appear in
the strength of his power from Heaven.
1.5 And all will be afraid, and the
Watchers will shake, and fear and great
trembling will seize them, up to the
ends of the earth.
1.6 And the high mountains will be
shaken; and the high hills will be laid
low and will melt like wax in a flame.
1.7 And the earth will sink, and
everything that is on the earth will be
destroyed, and there will be judgment
upon all, and upon all the righteous.
1.8 But for the righteous: He will make
peace, and He will keep safe the
Chosen, and mercy will be upon them.
They will all belong to God, and will
prosper and be blessed, and the light of
God will shine on them.
1.9 And behold! He comes with ten
thousand Holy Ones; to execute
judgment upon them and to destroy the
impious, and to contend with all flesh
concerning everything that the sinners
and the impious have done and wrought
against Him.
2.1 Contemplate all the events in the
sky; how the lights in the sky do not
change their courses, how each rises and
sets in order, each at its proper time, and
they do not transgress their law.
2.2 Consider the earth and understand
from the work that is done upon it, from
the beginning to the end, that no work
of God changes as it becomes manifest.
2.3 Consider the summer and the
winter; how the whole earth is full of
water and the clouds and dew and rain
rest upon it.
3.1 Contemplate and see how all the
trees appear withered and all their
leaves are stripped - with the exception
of the fourteen trees, which are not
stripped, which remain with the old
leaves until the new come after two or
three years.
4.1 And, again, contemplate the days
of summer; how at its beginning the
Sun is above it. You seek shelter and
shade because of the heat of the Sun and
the earth burns with scorching heat, and
you cannot tread upon the earth or upon
a rock, because of its heat.
4
5.1 Contemplate how the trees are
covered with green leaves and bear
fruit. And understand, in respect of
everything, and perceive how He Who
Lives Forever made all these things for
you.
5.2 And how His works are before Him
in each succeeding year, and all His
works serve Him and do not change; but
as God has decreed - so everything is
done.
5.3 And consider how the seas and
rivers together complete their tasks.
5.4 But you have not persevered in, nor
observed, the Law of the Lord. But you
have transgressed and have spoken
proud and hard words with your unclean
mouth against his majesty. You hard of
heart! You will not have peace!
5.5 And because of this you will curse
your days, and the years of your life you
will destroy. And the eternal curse will
increase and you will not receive mercy.
5.6 In those days, you will transform
your name into an eternal curse to all
the righteous. And they will curse you
sinners forever.
5.7 For the chosen; there will be light,
joy, and peace, and they will inherit the
earth. But for you, the impious, there
will be a curse.
5.8 When wisdom is given to the chosen
they will all live, and will not again do
wrong, either through forgetfulness, or
through pride. But those who possess
wisdom will be humble.
5.9 They will not again do wrong, and
they will not be judged in all the days of
their life, and they will not die of wrath
or anger. But they will complete the
number of the days of their life. And
their life will grow in peace, and the
years of their joy will increase in
gladness and eternal peace; all the days
of their life.
6.1 And it came to pass, when the sons
of men had increased, that in those days
there were born to them fair and
beautiful daughters.
6.2 And the Angels, the sons of Heaven,
saw them and desired them. And they
said to one another: "Come, let us
choose for ourselves wives, from the
children of men, and let us beget, for
ourselves, children."
6.3 And Semyaza, who was their leader,
said to them:
"I fear that you may not wish this deed
to be done and that I alone will pay for
this great sin."
6.4 And they all answered him, and
said:
"Let us all swear an oath, and bind oneanother with curses, so not to alter this
plan, but to carry out this plan
effectively."
6.5 Then they all swore together and all
bound one another with curses to it.
6.6 And they were, in all, two hundred
and they came down on Ardis, which is
the summit of Mount Hermon. And
they called the mountain Hermon
because on it they swore and bound one
another with curses.
6.7 And these are the names of their
leaders:
Semyaza, who was their leader, Urakiba
(Araqiel) , Rameel, Kokabiel, Tamiel,
Ramiel, Daniel, Ezeqiel, Baraqiel,
Asael, Armaros, Batariel, Ananel,
Zaqiel, Samsiel, Satariel, Turiel,
Yomiel, Sariel. (see Ch 8 & Ch 69)
6.8 These are the leaders of the two
hundred Angels and of all the others
with them.
7.1 And they took wives for
themselves and everyone chose for
himself one each. And they began to go
into them and were promiscuous with
them. And they taught them charms
and spells, and they showed them the
cutting of roots and trees.
7.2 And they became pregnant and bore
large giants. And their height was three
thousand cubits.
2
7.3 These devoured all the toil of men;
until men were unable to sustain them.
7.4 And the giants turned against them
in order to devour men.
7.5 And they began to sin against birds,
and against animals, and against
reptiles, and against fish, and they
devoured one another's flesh, and drank
the blood from it.
7.6 Then the Earth complained about
the lawless ones.
8.1 And Azazel taught men to make
swords, and daggers, and shields, and
breastplates. And he showed them the
things after these, and the art of making
them; bracelets, and ornaments, and the
art of making up the eyes, and of
beautifying the eyelids, and the most
precious stones, and all kinds of
coloured dyes. And the world was
changed.
8.2 And there was great impiety, and
much fornication, and they went astray,
and all their ways became corrupt.
8.3 Amezarak taught all those who cast
spells and cut roots, Armaros the release
of spells, and Baraqiel astrologers, and
Kokabiel portents, and Tamiel taught
astrology, and Asradel taught the path
of the Moon.
8.4 And at the destruction of men they
cried out; and their voices reached
Heaven.
9.1 And then Michael, Gabriel, Suriel
and Uriel, looked down from Heaven
and saw the mass of blood that was
being shed on the earth and all the
iniquity that was being done on the
earth.
9.2 And they said to one another: "Let
the devastated Earth cry out with the
sound of their cries, up to the Gate of
Heaven.
9.3 And now to you, Oh Holy Ones of
Heaven, the souls of men complain,
saying: "Bring our complaint before the
Most High."
9.4 And they said to their Lord, the
King: "Lord of Lords, God of Gods,
King of Kings! Your glorious throne
endures for all the generations of the
world, and blessed and praised!
9.5 You have made everything, and
power over everything is yours. And
everything is uncovered, and open, in
front of you, and you see everything,
and there is nothing that can be hidden
from you.
9.6 See then what Azazel has done; how
he has taught all iniquity on the earth
and revealed the eternal secrets that are
made in Heaven.
9.7 And Semyaza has made known
spells, he to whom you gave authority
to rule over those who are with him.
9.8 And they went into the daughters of
men together, lay with those women,
became unclean, and revealed to them
these sins.
9.9 And the women bore giants, and
thereby the whole Earth has been filled
with blood and iniquity.
9.10 And now behold the souls which
have died cry out and complain unto the
Gate of Heaven, and their lament has
ascended, and they cannot go out in the
face of the iniquity which is being
committed on the earth.
9.11 And you know everything, before
it happens, and you know this, and what
concerns each of them. But you say
nothing to us. What ought we to do
with them, about this?"
10.1 And then the Most High, the
Great and Holy One, spoke and sent
Arsyalalyur to the son of Lamech, and
said to him:
10.2 "Say to him in my name; hide
yourself! And reveal to him the end,
which is coming, because the whole
earth will be destroyed. A deluge is
about to come on all the earth; and all
that is in it will be destroyed.
10.3 And now teach him so that he may
escape and his offspring may survive
3
for the whole Earth."
10.4 And further the Lord said to
Raphael: "Bind Azazel by his hands
and his feet and throw him into the
darkness. And split open the desert,
which is in Dudael, and throw him
there.
10.5 And throw on him jagged and
sharp stones and cover him with
darkness. And let him stay there
forever. And cover his face so that he
may not see the light.
10.6 And so that, on the Great Day of
Judgment, he may be hurled into the
fire.
10.7 And restore the Earth which the
Angels have ruined. And announce the
restoration of the Earth. For I shall
restore the Earth so that not all the sons
of men shall be destroyed because of the
knowledge which the Watchers made
known and taught to their sons.
10.8 And the whole Earth has been
ruined by the teaching of the works of
Azazel; and against him write: ALL
SIN."
10.9 And the Lord said to Gabriel:
“Proceed against the bastards, and the
reprobates, and against the sons of the
fornicators. And destroy the sons of the
fornicators, and the sons of the
Watchers, from amongst men. And
send them out, and send them against
one another, and let them destroy
themselves in battle; for they will not
have length of days.
10.10 And they will petition you, but
the petitioners will gain nothing in
respect of them, for they hope for
eternal life, and that each of them will
live life for five hundred years."
10.11 And the Lord said to Michael:
"Go, inform Semyaza, and the others
with him, who have associated with the
women to corrupt themselves with them
in all their uncleanness.
10.12 When all their sons kill each
other, and when they see the destruction
of their loved ones, bind them for
seventy generations, under the hills of
the earth, until the day of their judgment
and of their consummation, until the
judgment, which is for all eternity, is
accomplished.
10.13 And in those days, they will lead
them to the Abyss of Fire; in torment,
and in prison they will be shut up for all
eternity.
10.14 And then Semyaza will be burnt,
and from then on destroyed with them;
together they will be bound until the
end of all generations.
10.15 And destroy all the souls of lust,
and the sons of the Watchers, for they
have wronged men.
10.16 Destroy all wrong from the face
of the Earth and every evil work will
cease.
10.17 And now all the righteous will be
humble, and will live until they beget
thousands. And all the days of their
youth, and their sabbaths, they will
fulfill in peace.
10.18 And in those days the whole earth
will be tilled in righteousness and all of
it will be planted with trees; and it will
be filled with blessing.
10.19 And all the pleasant trees they
will plant on it and they will plant on it
vines. And the vine that is planted on it
will produce fruit in abundance; and
every seed that is sown on it, each
measure will produce a thousand, and
each measure of olives will produce ten
baths of oil.
10.20 And you cleanse the Earth from
all wrong, and from all iniquity, and
from all sin, and from all impiety, and
from all the uncleanness which is
brought about on the earth.
10.21 And all the sons of men shall be
righteous, and all the nations shall serve
and bless me and all shall worship me.
10.22 And the Earth will be cleansed
from all corruption, and from all sin,
and from all wrath, and from all
torment; and I will not again send a
flood upon it, for all generations,
forever.
4
11.1 And in those days, I will open
the Storehouses of Blessing, which are
in Heaven, so that I may send them
down upon the Earth, upon the work,
and upon the toil, of the sons of men.
11.2 Peace and truth will be united, for
all the days of eternity, and for all the
generations of eternity.
12.1 And then Enoch disappeared
and none of the sons of men knew
where he was hidden, where he was, or
what had happened.
12.2 And all his doings were with the
Holy Ones, and with the Watchers, in
his days.
12.3 And I Enoch, was blessing the
Great Lord and the King of Eternity.
And behold, the Watchers called to me -
Enoch the scribe - and said to me:
12.4 "Enoch, scribe of righteousness.
Go and inform the Watchers of Heaven,
who have left the High Heaven and the
Holy Eternal Place, and have corrupted
themselves with women, and have done
as the sons of men do and have taken
wives for themselves, and have become
completely corrupt on the earth.
12.5 They will have on Earth, neither
peace, nor forgiveness of sin, for they
will not rejoice in their sons.
12.6 The slaughter of their beloved ones
they will see; and over the destruction
of their sons they will lament and
petition forever. But they will have
neither mercy nor peace.”
13.1 And Enoch went and said to
Azazel: "You will not have peace. A
severe sentence has come out against
you that you should be bound.
13.2 And you will have neither rest nor
mercy, nor the granting of any petitions,
because of the wrong which you have
taught, and because of all the works of
blasphemy and wrong and sin which
you have shown to the sons of men."
13.3 And then I went and spoke to them
all together, and they were all afraid;
fear and trembling seized them.
13.4 And they asked me to write out for
them the record of a petition, so that
they might receive forgiveness, and to
take a record of their petition up to the
Lord in Heaven.
13.5 For they were not able, from then
on, to speak, and they did not raise their
eyes to Heaven, out of shame for the
sins, for which they had been
condemned.
13.6 And then I wrote out the record of
their petition, and their supplication in
regard to their spirits, and the deeds of
each one of them, and in regard to what
they asked; that they should obtain
absolution and forbearance.
13.7 And I went and sat down by the
waters of Dan, in Dan, which is
southwest of Hermon; and I read out the
record of their petition, until I fell
asleep.
13.8 And behold a dream came to me,
and visions fell upon me, and I saw a
vision of wrath; that I should speak to
the sons of Heaven and reprove them.
13.9 And I woke up and went to them,
and they were all sitting gathered
together as they mourned, in
Ubelseyael, which is between Lebanon
and Senir, with their faces covered.
13.10 And I spoke in front of them all;
the visions that I had seen in my sleep,
and I began to speak these words to
reprove the Watchers of Heaven.

14.1 This book is the word of
righteousness, and of reproof, for the
Watchers who are from Eternity; as the
Holy and Great One commanded in that
vision.
14.2 I saw in my sleep what I will now
tell, with the tongue of flesh, and with
my breath, which the Great One has
given men in the mouth, so that they
might speak with it, and understand
with the heart.
5
14.3 As He has created, and appointed,
men to understand the word of
knowledge, so He created and appointed
me to reprove the Watchers, the sons of
Heaven.
14.4 And I wrote out your petition, but
in my vision, thus it appeared, that your
petition would not be granted to you, for
all the days of eternity; and complete
judgment has been decreed against you,
and you will not have peace.
14.5 And from now on, you will not
ascend into Heaven, for all eternity, and
it has been decreed that you will be
bound on Earth for all the days of
eternity.
14.6 And before this, you will have seen
the destruction of your beloved sons,
and you will not be able to enjoy them,
but they will fall before you by the
sword.
14.7 And your petition will not be
granted in respect of them or in respect
of yourselves. And while you weep and
supplicate you do not speak a single
word from the writings which I have
written.
14.8 And the vision appeared to me, as
follows: - Behold; clouds called me in
the vision, and mist called me. And the
path of the stars, and flashes of
lightning, hastened me and drove me.
And in the vision winds caused me to
fly, and hastened me, and lifted me up
into the sky.
14.9 And I proceeded until I came near
a wall which was made of hailstones,
and a tongue of fire surrounded it, and it
began to make me afraid.
14.10 And I went into the tongue of fire
and came near to a large house, which
was built of hailstones, and the wall of
that house was like a mosaic of
hailstones and its floor was snow.
14.11 Its roof was like the path of the
stars and flashes of lightning, and
among them was fiery cherubim, and
their sky was like water.
14.12 And there was a fire burning
around its wall and its door was ablaze
with fire.
14.13 And I went into that house, and it
was as hot as fire and as cold as snow,
and there was neither pleasure nor life
in it. Fear covered me and trembling
took hold of me.
14.14 And as I was shaking and
trembling, I fell on my face.
14.15 And I saw in the vision, and
behold, another house which was larger
than the former and all its doors were
open before me, and it was built of a
tongue of fire.
14.16 And in everything, it so excelled
in glory and splendor and size, so that I
am unable to describe to you its glory
and its size.
14.17 And its floor was fire, and above
lightning and the path of the stars, and
its roof also was a burning fire.
14.18 And I looked, and I saw in it, a
high throne, and its appearance was like
ice, and its surrounds like the shining
Sun and the sound of cherubim.
14.19 And from underneath the high
throne there flowed out rivers of fire so
that it was impossible to look at it.
14.20 And He who is Great in Glory sat
upon it, and his raiment was brighter
than the Sun, and whiter than any snow.
14.21 And no Angel could enter, and at
the appearance of the face of Him who
is Honoured and Praised, no creature of
flesh could look.
14.22 A sea of fire burnt around Him,
and a great fire stood in front of Him,
and none of those around Him came
near to Him. Ten thousand times ten
thousand stood before Him but He
needed no Holy Council.
14.23 And the Holy Ones who were
near to Him did not leave by night or
day and did not depart from Him.
14.24 And until then I had a covering
on my face, as I trembled. And the
Lord called me with his own mouth, and
said to me: "Come here, Enoch, to my
Holy Word."
14.25 And He lifted me up and brought
me near to the door. And I looked, with
6
my face down.
15.1 And He answered me, and said
to me with His voice: "Hear! Do not be
afraid, Enoch, you righteous man, and
scribe of righteousness. Come here and
hear my voice.
15.2 And go say to the Watchers of
Heaven, who sent you to petition on
their behalf: You ought to petition on
behalf of men, not men on behalf of
you.
15.3 Why have you left the High, Holy
and Eternal Heaven, and lain with
women, and become unclean with the
daughters of men, and taken wives for
yourselves, and done as the sons of the
earth, and begotten giant sons?
15.4 And you were spiritual, Holy,
living an eternal life, but you became
unclean upon the women, and begot
children through the blood of flesh, and
lusted after the blood of men, and
produced flesh and blood, as they do,
who die and are destroyed.
15.5 And for this reason I give men
wives; so that they might sow seed in
them, and so that children might be born
by them, so that deeds might be done on
the Earth.
15.6 But you, formerly, were spiritual,
living an eternal, immortal life, for all
the generations of the world.
15.7 For this reason I did not arrange
wives for you; because the dwelling of
the spiritual ones is in Heaven.
15.8 And now, the giants who were
born from body and flesh will be called
Evil Spirits on the Earth, and on the
Earth will be their dwelling.
15.9 And evil spirits came out from
their flesh, because from above they
were created, from the Holy Watchers
was their origin and first foundation.
Evil spirits they will be on Earth and
‘Spirits of the Evil Ones’ they will be
called.
15.10 And the dwelling of the Spirits of
Heaven is Heaven, but the dwelling of
the spirits of the Earth, who were born
on the Earth, is Earth.
15.11 And the spirits of the giants do
wrong, are corrupt, attack, fight, break
on the Earth, and cause sorrow. And
they eat no food, do not thirst, and are
not observed.
15.12 And these spirits will rise against
the sons of men, and against the
women, because they came out of them
during the days of slaughter and
destruction.
16.1 And the death of the giants,
wherever the spirits have gone out from
their bodies, their flesh will be
destroyed, before the Judgment. Thus
they will be destroyed until the Day of
the Great Consummation is
accomplished, upon the Great Age,
upon the Watchers and the impious
ones."
16.2 And now to the Watchers, who
sent you to petition on their behalf, who
were formerly in Heaven:
16.3 "You were in Heaven but its
secrets had not yet been revealed to you;
and a worthless mystery you knew.
This you made known to women, in the
hardness of your hearts. And through
this mystery the women and the men
cause evil to increase on the Earth."
16.4 Say to them therefore: "You will
not have peace."
17.1 And they took me to a place
where they were like burning fire, and,
when they wished, they made
themselves look like men.
17.2 And they led me to a place of
storm, and to a mountain, the tip of
whose summit reached to Heaven.
17.3 And I saw lighted places, and
thunder in the outermost ends, in its
depths a bow of fire, and arrows and
their quivers, and a sword of fire, and
all the flashes of lightning.
17.4 And they took me to the Water of
Life, as it is called, and to the Fire of the
7
West, which receives every setting of
the Sun.
17.5 And I came to a river of fire,
whose fire flows like water, and pours
out into the Great Sea, which is towards
the west.
17.6 And I saw all the great rivers, and I
reached the Great Darkness, and went
where all flesh walks.
17.7 And I saw the Mountains of the
Darkness of Winter and the place where
the water of all the deeps pours out.
17.8 And I saw the mouths of all the
rivers of the Earth, and the mouth of the
deep.
18.1 And I saw the storehouses of all
the winds, and I saw how with them He
has adorned all creation, and I saw the
foundations of the Earth.
18.2 And I saw the cornerstone of the
Earth. And I saw the four winds which
support the Earth and the sky.
18.3 And I saw how the winds stretch
out the height of Heaven, and how they
position themselves between Heaven
and Earth; they are the Pillars of
Heaven.
18.4 And I saw the winds which turn
the sky and cause the disc of the Sun
and all the stars to set.
18.5 And I saw the winds on the Earth
which support the clouds and I saw the
paths of the Angels. I saw at the end of
the Earth; the firmament of Heaven
above.
18.6 And I went towards the south, and
it was burning day and night, where
there were seven mountains of precious
stones, three towards the east and three
towards the south.
18.7 And those towards the east were of
coloured stone, and one was of pearl,
and one of healing stone; and those
towards the south, of red stone.
18.8 And the middle one reached to
Heaven, like the throne of the Lord, of
stibium, and the top of the throne was of
sapphire.
18.9 And I saw a burning fire, and what
was in all the mountains.
18.10 And I saw a place there, beyond
the great earth; there the waters
gathered together.
18.11 And I saw a deep chasm of the
earth, with pillars of heavenly fire, and I
saw among them fiery pillars of
Heaven, which were falling, and as
regards both height and depth, they
were immeasurable.
18.12 And beyond this chasm, I saw a
place, and it had neither the sky above
it, nor the foundation of earth below it;
there was no water on it, and no birds,
but it was a desert place.
18.13 And a terrible thing I saw there,
seven stars, like great burning
mountains.
18.14 And like a spirit questioning me,
the Angel said: “This is the place of the
end of Heaven and Earth; this is the
prison for the Stars of Heaven and the
Host of Heaven.
18.15 And the stars which roll over the
fire, these are the ones which
transgressed the command of the Lord,
from the beginning of their rising,
because they did not come out at their
proper times.
18.16 And He was angry with them, and
bound them until the time of the
consummation of their sin, in the Year
of Mystery.”
19.1 And Uriel said to me: “The
spirits of the Angels who were
promiscuous with women will stand
here; and they, assuming many forms,
made men unclean and will lead men
astray so that they sacrifice to demons
as gods. And they will stand there until
the great judgment day, on which they
will be judged, so that an end will be
made of them.
19.2 And their wives, having led astray
the Angels of Heaven, will become
peaceful.”
19.3 And I, Enoch, alone saw the sight,
the ends of everything; and no man has
seen what I have seen.
8
20.1 And these are the names of the
Holy Angels who keep watch.
20.2 Uriel, one of the Holy Angels;
namely the Holy Angel of the Spirits of
Men.
20.4 Raguel, one of the Holy Angels;
who takes vengeance on the world, and
on the lights.
20.5 Michael, one of the Holy Angels,
namely the one put in charge of the best
part of humankind, in charge of the
nation.
20.6 Saraqael, one of the Holy Angels;
who is in charge of the spirits of men
who cause the spirits to sin.
20.7 Gabriel, one of the Holy Angels,
who is in charge of the Serpents, and the
Garden, and the Cherubim.
21.1 And I went round to a place
where nothing was made.
21.2 And I saw a terrible thing, neither
the High Heaven nor the firm ground,
but a desert place, prepared and terrible.
21.3 And there, I saw seven Stars of
Heaven, bound on it together, like great
mountains, and burning like fire.
21.4 Then I said: “For what sin have
they been bound, and why have they
been thrown here?”
21.5 And Uriel, one of the Holy Angels,
who was with me and led me, spoke to
me and said: "Enoch, about whom do
you ask? About whom do you inquire,
ask, and care?
21.6 These are some of the stars which
transgressed the command of the Lord
Most High, and they have been bound
here until ten thousand ages are
completed; the number of days of their
sin."
21.7 And from there I went to another
place, more terrible than this. And I
saw a terrible thing: there was a great
fire there, which burnt and blazed. And
the place had a cleft reaching into the
abyss, full of great pillars of fire, which
were made to fall; neither its extent nor
its size could I see, nor could I see its
source.
21.8 Then I said: "How terrible this
place is, and how painful to look at!"
21.9 Then Uriel, one of the Holy
Angels, who was with me, answered
me. He answered me and said to me:
"Enoch, why do you have such fear and
terror because of this terrible place, and
before this pain?"
21.10 And he said to me: "This place is
the prison of the Angels, and there they
will be held for ever."
22.1 And from there, I went to
another place, and he showed me in the
west a large and high mountain, and a
hard rock, and four beautiful places.
22.2 And inside, it was deep, wide, and
very smooth. How smooth is that which
rolls, and deep and dark to look at!
22.3 Then Raphael, one of the Holy
Angels who was with me, answered me,
and said to me: "These beautiful places
are there so that the spirits, the souls of
the dead, might be gathered into them.
For them they were created; so that here
they might gather the souls of the sons
of men.
22.4 And these places they made, where
they will keep them until the Day of
Judgment, and until their appointed
time, and that appointed time will be
long, until the great judgment comes
upon them.
22.5 And I saw the spirits of the sons of
men who were dead and their voices
reached Heaven and complained.
22.6 Then I asked Raphael, the Angel
who was with me, and said to him:
"Whose is this spirit, whose voice thus
reaches Heaven and complains?"
22.7 And he answered me, and said to
me, saying: "This spirit is the one that
came out of Abel, whom Cain, his
brother, killed. And he will complain
about him until his offspring are
destroyed from the face of the Earth,
and from amongst the offspring of men,
9
his offspring perish."
22.8 Then I asked about him, and about
judgment on all, and I said: "Why is
one separated from another?"
22.9 And he answered me, and said to
me: "These three places where made, in
order that they might separate the spirits
of the dead. And thus the souls of the
righteous have been separated; this is
the spring of water, and on it the light.
22.10 Likewise, a place has been
created for sinners, when they die, and
are buried in the earth, and judgment
has not come upon them during their
life.
22.11 And here their souls will be
separated for this great torment, until
the Great Day of Judgment and
Punishment and Torment for those who
curse, forever, and of vengeance on
their souls. And there he will bind them
forever. Verily, He is, from the
beginning of the world.
22.12 And thus a place has been
separated for the souls of those who
complain, and give information about
their destruction, about when they were
killed, in the days of the sinners.
22.13 Thus a place has been created, for
the souls of men who are not righteous,
but sinners, accomplished in
wrongdoing, and with the wrongdoers
will be their lot. But their souls will not
be killed on the day of judgment, nor
will they rise from here."
22.14 Then I blessed the Lord of Glory,
and said: "Blessed be my Lord, the
Lord of Glory and Righteousness, who
rules everything forever."
23.1 And from there I went to
another place, towards the west, to the
ends of the Earth.
23.2 And I saw a fire that burnt and ran,
without resting or ceasing from running,
by day or by night, but continued in
exactly the same way.
23.3 And I asked saying: "What is this
which has no rest?"
23.4 Then Raguel, one of the Holy
Angels, who was with me, answered
me, and said to me: “This burning fire,
whose course you saw towards the west,
is the fire of all the Lights of Heaven.”
24.1 And from there I went to
another place of the Earth and he
showed me a mountain of fire that
blazed day and night.
24.2 And I went towards it and saw
seven magnificent mountains. And all
were different from one another, and
precious and beautiful stones, and all
were precious, and their appearance
glorious, and their form was beautiful.
Three towards the east one fixed firmly
on another and three towards the south
one on another, and deep and rugged
valleys, no one of which was near
another.
24.3 And there was a seventh mountain,
in the middle of these, and in their
height they were all like the seat of a
throne and fragrant trees surrounded it.
24.4 And there was among them a tree
such as which I have never smelt, and
none of them, or any others, were like it.
It smells more fragrant than any
fragrance, and its leaves, and its
flowers, and its wood never wither. Its
fruit is good, and its fruit is like bunches
of dates on a palm.
24.5 And then I said: "Behold, this
beautiful tree! Beautiful to look at, and
pleasant are its leaves, and its fruit very
delightful in appearance."
24.6 And then Michael, one of the Holy
and Honoured Angels, who was with
me, and was in charge of them,
25.1 answered me and said to me:
“Enoch, why do you ask me about the
fragrance of this tree, and why do you
inquire to learn?”
25.2 Then I, Enoch, answered him
saying: “I wish to learn about
everything, but especially about this
10
tree.”
25.3 And he answered me, saying:
“This high mountain, which you saw,
whose summit is like the Throne of the
Lord, is the throne where the Holy and
Great One, the Lord of Glory, the
Eternal King, will sit, when he comes
down to visit the Earth for good.
25.4 And this beautiful and fragrant
tree, and no creature of flesh has
authority to touch it until the great
judgment, when he will take vengeance
on all and bring everything to a
consummation forever, this will be
given to the righteous and the humble.
25.5 From its fruit, life will be given to
the chosen; towards the north it will be
planted, in a Holy place, by the house of
the Lord, the Eternal King.
25.6 Then they will rejoice with joy and
be glad in the Holy place. They will
each draw the fragrance of it into their
bones, and they will live a long life on
earth, as your fathers lived. And in their
days sorrow and pain, and toil and
punishment, will not touch them.”
25.7 Then I blessed the Lord of Glory,
the Eternal King, because he has
prepared such things for righteous men,
and has created such things, and said
that they are to be given to them.
26.1 And from there, I went to the
middle of the earth, and saw a blessed,
well watered place, which had branches
which remained alive, and sprouted
from a tree which had been cut down.
26.2 And there I saw a holy mountain,
and under the mountain, to the east of it,
there was water, and it flowed towards
the south.
26.3 And I saw towards the east,
another mountain, which was of the
same height, and between them, there
was a deep and narrow valley; and in it,
a stream ran by the mountain.
26.4 And to the west of this one, was
another mountain, which was lower
than it was and not high; and under it,
there was a valley between them. And
there were other deep and dry valleys at
the end of the three mountains.
26.5 And all the valleys were deep and
narrow, of hard rock, and trees were
planted on them.
26.6 And I was amazed at the rock, and
I was amazed at the valley; I was very
much amazed.
27.1 Then I said: "What is the
purpose of this blessed land, which is
completely full of trees, and of this
accursed valley in the middle of them?"
27.2 Then Raphael, one of the Holy
Angels who was with me, answered me,
and said to me: "This accursed valley,
is for those who are cursed for ever.
Here will be gathered together all who
speak with their mouths against the
Lord - words that are not fitting, and say
hard things about His Glory. Here they
will gather them together, and here will
be their place of judgment.
27.3 And in the last days there will be
the spectacle of the righteous judgment
upon them, in front of the righteous,
forever. For here, the merciful will
bless the Lord of Glory the Eternal
King.
27.4 And in the days of the judgment on
them they will bless Him, on account of
his mercy, according as He has assigned
to them their lot."
27.5 Then I myself blessed the Lord of
Glory, I addressed Him, and I
remembered His majesty, as was fitting.
28.1 And from there, I went towards
the east, to the middle of the mountain
of the wilderness, and I saw only desert.
28.2 But it was full of trees from this
seed and water gushed out over it from
above.
28.3 The torrent, which flowed towards
the northwest, seemed copious, and
from all sides, there went up spray and
mist.
29.1 And I went to another place,
11
away from the wilderness; I came near
to the east of this mountain.
29.2 And there I saw Trees of
Judgment, especially vessels of the
fragrance of incense and myrrh, and the
trees were not alike.
30.1 And above it, above these,
above the mountains of the east, and not
far away, I saw another place, valleys of
water, like that which does not fail.
30.2 And I saw a beautiful tree, and its
fragrance was like that of the mastic.
30.3 And by the banks of these valleys I
saw fragrant cinnamon. And beyond
those valleys I came towards the east.
31.1 And I saw another mountain on
which there were trees, and there flowed
out water, and there flowed out from it,
as it were, a nectar whose name is
styrax and galbanum.
31.2 And beyond this mountain I saw
another mountain, and on it there were
aloe trees, and those trees were full of a
fruit, which is like an almond, and is
hard.
31.3 And when they take this fruit it is
better than any fragrance.
32.1 And after these fragrances, to
the north, as I looked over the
mountains, I saw seven mountains full
of fine nard, and fragrant trees of
cinnamon and pepper.
32.2 And from there, I went over the
summits of those mountains, far away
to the east, and I went over the Red Sea,
and I was far from it, and I went over
the Angel Zotiel.
32.3 And I came to the Garden of
Righteousness, and I saw beyond those
trees many large trees growing there,
sweet smelling, large, very beautiful and
glorious, the Trees of Wisdom, from
which they eat and know great wisdom.
32.4 And it is like the carob tree, and its
fruit is like bunches of grapes on a vine,
very beautiful, and the smell of this tree
spreads and penetrates afar.
32.5 And I said: "This tree is beautiful!
How beautiful and pleasing is its
appearance!"
32.6 And the Holy Angel Raphael, who
was with me, answered me and said to
me: "This is the Tree of Wisdom, from
which your ancient father and ancient
mother, who were before you, ate and
learnt wisdom; and their eyes were
opened, and they knew that they were
naked. And they were driven from the
garden."
33.1 And from there I went to the
ends of the earth, and I saw there large
animals, each different from the other,
and also birds, which differed in form,
beauty, and call - each different from
the other.
33.2 And to the east of these animals, I
saw the ends of the Earth, on which
Heaven rests, and the open Gates of
Heaven.
33.3 And I saw how the stars of Heaven
come out, and counted the Gates out of
which they come, and wrote down all
their outlets, for each one, individually,
according to their number. And their
names, according to their constellations,
their positions, their times, and their
months, as the Angel Uriel, who was
with me, showed me.
33.4 And he showed me everything, and
wrote it down, and also their names he
wrote down for me, and their laws and
their functions.
34.1 And from there I went towards
the north, to the ends of the Earth, and
there I saw a great and glorious wonder
at the ends of the whole Earth.
34.2 And there I saw three Gates of
Heaven; through each of them north
winds go out; when they blow there is
cold, hail, hoarfrost, snow, fog, and
rain.
34.3 And from one Gate, it blows for
good; but when they blow through the
12
other two Gates, it is with force, and it
brings torment over the earth, and they
blow with force.
35.1 And from there I went towards
the west, to the ends of the Earth, and I
saw there, as I saw in the east, three
open Gates - as many Gates and as
many outlets.
36.1 And from there I went towards
the south, to the ends of the Earth, and
there I saw three Gates of Heaven open;
and the south wind, the mist, and the
rain, and wind, come out from there.
36.2 And from there I went towards the
east of the ends of Heaven, and there I
saw the three eastern Gates of Heaven
open, and above them, there were
smaller Gates.
36.3 Through each of these smaller
Gates, the stars of Heaven pass, and go
towards the west, on the path that has
been shown to them.
36.4 And when I saw, I blessed, and I
will always bless the Lord of Glory,
who has made Great and Glorious
Wonders so that he might show the
greatness of His Work, to His Angels,
and to the souls of men, so that they
might praise His Work. And so that all
his creatures might see the work of His
Power, and praise the great work of His
Hands, and bless Him forever!
Section II. Chapters XXXVIILXXI
The Parables
37.1 The second vision that he saw,
the vision of wisdom, which Enoch, the
son of Jared, the son of Malalel, the son
of Cainan, the son of Enosh, the son of
Seth, the son of Adam, saw.
37.2 And this is the beginning of the
words of wisdom, which I raised my
voice to speak, and say. “To those who
dwell on dry ground: - Hear, you men
of old, and see, those who come after;
the words of the Holy One, which I will
speak, in front of the Lord of Spirits.”
37.3 “It would have been better to have
said these things before, but from those
who come after, we will not withhold
the beginning of wisdom.”
37.4 Until now, there has not been
given, by the Lord of Spirits, such
wisdom as I have received. In
accordance with my insight, in
accordance with the wish of the Lord of
Spirits: by whom the lot of eternal life
has been given to me.
37.5 And the three parables were
imparted to me and I raised my voice,
and said to those who dwell on the dry
ground: -
38.1 The First Parable.
When the community of the righteous
appears and the sinners are judged for
their sins and are driven from the face
of the dry ground.
38.2 And when the Righteous One
appears, in front of the chosen
righteous, whose works are weighed by
the Lord of Spirits. And when light
appears to the righteous and chosen who
dwell on the dry ground. Where will be
the dwelling of the sinners? And where
will be the resting-place of those who
denied the Lord of Spirits? It would
have been better for them, if they had
not been born.
38.3 And when the secrets of the
righteous are revealed, the sinners will
be judged, and the impious driven from
the presence of the righteous and the
chosen.
38.4 And from then on, those who
possess the earth will not be mighty and
exalted. Nor will they be able to look at
the face of the Holy ones, for the light
of the Lord of the Spirits will have
appeared on the face of the Holy, the
righteous, and the chosen.
13
38.5 And the mighty kings will at that
time be destroyed and given into the
hand of the righteous and the Holy.
38.6 And from then on no one will be
able to seek the Lord of Spirits for their
life will be at an end.
39.1 And it will come to pass in
these days that the chosen and holy
children will come down from the high
Heavens and their offspring will
become one with the sons of men.
39.2 In those days Enoch received
books of indignation and anger and
books of tumult and confusion. And
there will be no mercy for them, says
the Lord of Spirits.
39.3 And at that time clouds and a
storm wind carried me off from the face
of the earth and set me down at the end
of Heaven.
39.4 And there I saw another vision; the
Dwelling of the Righteous and the
Resting-Places of the Holy.
39.5 There my eyes saw their dwelling
with the Angels, and their resting places
with the Holy Ones, and they were
petitioning and supplicating and
praying, on behalf of the sons of men;
and righteousness, like water, flowed in
front of them, and mercy like dew on
the ground. Thus it is among them
forever and ever.
39.6 And in those days my eyes saw the
Place of the Chosen Ones of
Righteousness and Faith; and there will
be righteousness in their days, and the
righteous and chosen will be without
number, in front of him, forever and
ever.
39.7 And I saw their dwelling, under the
Wings of the Lord of Spirits, and all the
righteous and chosen shone in front of
him, like the light of fire. And their
mouths were full of blessing, and their
lips praised the name of the Lord of
Spirits. And righteousness will not fail
in front of him, and truth will not fail in
front of him.
39.8 There I wished to dwell, and my
soul longed for that dwelling; there had
my lot been assigned before, for thus it
was decided about me, in front of the
Lord of Spirits.
39.9 And in those days I praised and
exalted the name of the Lord of Spirits,
with blessing and praise, for he has
destined me for blessing and praise, in
accordance with the Lord of Spirits.
39.10 And for a long time my eyes
looked at that place, and I blessed him
and praised him, saying: "Blessed is
He, and may He be blessed from the
beginning and for ever!"
39.11 And in his presence there is no
end. He knew before the world was
created what the world would be, even
for all the generations that are to come.
39.12 Those who do not sleep bless
you, and they stand before Your Glory,
and bless and praise and exalt, saying:
"Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord of Spirits; he
fills the earth with spirits."
39.13 And there, my eyes saw all those
who do not sleep; standing in front of
Him, and blessing, and saying:
"Blessed are you, and blessed is the
name of the Lord, for ever and ever!"
39.14 And my face was transformed
until I was unable to see.
40.1 And after this I saw a thousand
thousands and ten thousand times ten
thousand! A multitude beyond number,
or reckoning, who stood in front of the
Glory of the Lord of Spirits.
40.2 I looked, and on the four sides of
the Lord of Spirits, I saw four figures,
different from those who were standing;
and I learnt their names, because the
Angel who went with me made known
their names, and showed me all the
secret things.
40.3 And I heard the voices of those
four figures as they sang praises in front
of the Lord of Glory.
40.4 The first voice blesses the Lord of
Spirits forever and ever.
40.5 And the second voice I heard
blessing the Chosen One and the chosen
14
who depend on the Lord of Spirits.
40.6 And the third voice I heard,
petitioned, and prayed, on behalf of
those who dwell on dry ground and
supplicate in the name of the Lord of
Spirits.
40.7 And the fourth voice I heard
driving away the Satans and not
allowing them to come in front of the
Lord of Spirits to accuse those who
dwell on the high ground.
40.8 And after this I asked the Angel of
Peace, who went with me, and showed
me everything which is secret: "Who
are those four figures, whom I have
seen, and whose words I have heard and
written down?"
40.9 And he said to me: "This first one,
is the Holy Michael, the merciful and
long-suffering. And the second, who is
in charge of all the diseases, and in
charge of all the wounds of the sons of
men, is Raphael. And the third, who is
in charge of all the powers, is the Holy
Gabriel. And the fourth, who is in
charge of repentance and hope of those
who will inherit eternal life, is
Phanuel.”
40.10 And these are the four Angels of
the Lord Most High; and the four voices
that I heard in those days.
41.1 And after this, I saw all the
secrets of Heaven, and how the
Kingdom is divided, and how the deeds
of men are weighed in the Balance.
41.2 There I saw the Dwelling of the
Chosen, and the Resting Places of the
Holy; and my eyes saw there all the
sinners who deny the name of the Lord
of Spirits being driven from there. And
they dragged them off, and they were
not able to remain, because of the
punishment that went out from the Lord
of Spirits.
41.3 And there my eyes saw the secrets
of the flashes of lightning and of the
thunder. And the secrets of the winds,
how they are distributed in order to
blow over the earth, and the secrets of
the clouds, and of the dew; and there I
saw from where they go out, in that
place. And how, from there, the dust of
the earth is saturated.
41.4 And there I saw closed storehouses
from which the winds are distributed,
and the storehouse of the hail, and the
storehouse of the mist, and the
storehouse of the clouds; and its cloud
remained over the earth, from the
beginning of the world.
41.5 And I saw the Chambers of the
Sun and the Moon, where they go out,
and where they return. And their
glorious return; and how one is more
honoured than the other is. And their
magnificent course, and how they do
not leave their course, neither adding
nor subtracting from their course. And
how they keep faith in one another,
observing their oath.
41.6 And the Sun goes out first, and
completes its journey at the command
of the Lord of Spirits - and his Name
endures forever and ever.
41.7 And after this is the hidden, and
visible, path of the Moon, and it travels
the course of its journey, in that place,
by day and by night. One stands
opposite the other, in front of the Lord
of Spirits, and they give thanks, and
sing praise, and do not rest, because
their thanksgiving is like rest to them.
41.8 For the shining Sun makes many
revolutions; for a blessing and for a
curse. And the path of the journey of
the Moon is for the righteous light but
for the sinners; darkness. In the Name
of the Lord, who has created a division
between light and darkness, and has
divided the spirits of men, and has
established the spirits of the righteous,
in the name of His Righteousness.
41.9 For no Angel hinders, and no
power is able to hinder, because the
judge sees them all, and judges them all
Himself.
42.1 Wisdom found no place where
she could dwell, and her dwelling was
15
in Heaven.
42.2 Wisdom went out, in order to
dwell among the sons of men, but did
not find a dwelling; wisdom returned to
her place, and took her seat in the midst
of the Angels.
42.3 And iniquity came out from her
chambers; those whom she did not seek
she found, and dwelt among them, like
rain in the desert, and like dew on the
parched ground.
43.1 And again I saw flashes of
lightning and the stars of Heaven, and I
saw how He called them all by their
names, and they obeyed Him.
43.2 And I saw the Balance of
Righteousness, how they are weighed
according to their light, according to the
width of their areas, and the day of their
appearing. And how their revolutions
produce lightning, and I saw their
revolutions, according to the number of
the Angels, and how they keep faith
with one another.
43.3 And I asked the Angel, who went
with me and showed me what is secret:
"What are these?"
43.4 And he said to me: "Their
likeness, the Lord of Spirits has shown
to you; these are the names of the
righteous who, dwell on the dry ground
and believe in the name of the Lord of
Spirits for ever and ever."
44.1 And other things I saw
concerning lightning, how some of the
stars rise and become lightning but
cannot lose their form.
45.1 And this is The Second
Parable. About those who deny the
Name of the Dwelling of the Holy Ones
and of the Lord of Spirits.
45.2 They will not ascend into Heaven
nor will they come upon the earth; such
will be the lot of the sinners who deny
the Name of the Lord of Spirits who
will thus be kept for the Day of
Affliction and Distress.
45.3 “On that day the Chosen One will
sit on the Throne of Glory and will
choose their works. And their resting
places will be without number and their
spirits within them will grow strong
when they see My Chosen One and
those who appeal to My Holy and
Glorious Name.
45.4 And on that day I will cause My
Chosen One to dwell among them and I
will transform Heaven and make it an
Eternal Blessing and Light.
45.5 And I will transform the dry
ground and make it a blessing, and I
will cause My Chosen Ones to dwell
upon it; but those who commit sin and
evil will not tread upon it.
45.6 For I have seen, and have satisfied
with peace, My Righteous Ones, and
have placed them in front of Me; but for
the sinners My Judgement draws near
so that I may destroy them from the face
of the earth.”
46.1 And there I saw one who had a
‘Head of Days’ and his head was white
like wool. And with him there was
another whose face had the appearance
of a man and his face was full of grace
like one of the Holy Angels.
46.2 And I asked one of the Holy
Angels, who went with me and showed
me all the secrets, about that Son of
Man, who he was, and from where he
was, and why he went with the Head of
Days.
46.3 And he answered me, and said to
me:
"This is the Son of Man who has
righteousness and with whom
righteousness dwells. He will reveal all
the treasures of that which is secret, for
the Lord of Spirits has chosen him, and
through uprightness his lot has
surpassed all others, in front of the Lord
of Spirits, forever.
46.4 And this Son of Man, who you
have seen, will rouse the kings and the
16
powerful from their resting places, and
the strong from their thrones, and will
loose the reins of the strong, and will
break the teeth of the sinners.
46.5 And he will cast down the kings
from their thrones, and from their
kingdoms, for they do not exalt him,
and do not praise him, and do not
humbly acknowledge from where their
kingdom was given to them.
46.6 And he will cast down the faces of
the strong and shame will fill them, and
darkness will be their dwelling, and
worms will be their resting place. And
they will have no hope of rising from
their resting-places, for they do not exalt
the name of the Lord of Spirits.
46.7 And these are they who judge the
Stars of Heaven, and raise their hands
against the Most High, and trample
upon the dry ground, and dwell upon it.
And all their deeds show iniquity, and
their power rests on their riches, and
their faith is in their gods that they have
made with their hands, and they deny
the name of the Lord of Spirits.
46.8 And they will be driven from the
houses of his congregation, and of the
faithful, who depend on the Name of the
Lord of Spirits.
47.1 And in those days, the prayer of
the righteous, and the blood of the
righteous will have ascended from the
Earth in front of the Lord of Spirits.
47.2 In these days the Holy Ones who
live in Heaven above will unite with one
voice, and supplicate, and pray, and
praise, and give thanks, and bless, in the
name of the Lord of Spirits. Because of
the blood of the righteous that has been
poured out. And because of the prayer
of the righteous, so that it may not cease
in front of the Lord of Spirits, so that
justice might be done to them, and that
their patience may not have to last
forever."
47.3 And in those days, I saw the Head
of Days sit down on the Throne of his
Glory and the Books of the Living were
opened in front of him and all His Host,
which dwell in the Heavens above, and
his Council were standing in front of
Him.
47.4 And the hearts of the Holy Ones
were full of joy that the number of
righteousness had been reached, and the
prayer of the righteous had been heard,
and the blood of the righteous had not
been required in front of the Lord of
Spirits.
48.1 And in that place I saw an
inexhaustible spring of righteousness
and many springs of wisdom
surrounded it, and all the thirsty drank
from them and were filled with wisdom,
and their dwelling was with the
Righteous and the Holy and the Chosen.
48.2 And at that hour that Son of Man
was named, in the presence of the Lord
of Spirits, and his name brought to the
Head of Days.
48.3 Even before the Sun and the
constellations were created, before the
Stars of Heaven were made, his name
was named in front of the Lord of
Spirits.
48.4 He will be a staff to the righteous
and the Holy, so that they may lean on
him and not fall, and he will be the
Light of the Nations, and he will be the
hope of those who grieve in their hearts.
48.5 All those who dwell upon the dry
ground will fall down and worship in
front of him, and they will bless, and
praise, and celebrate with psalms, the
name of the Lord of Spirits.
48.6 And because of this he was chosen,
and hidden in front of Him, before the
World was created, and forever.
48.7 But the wisdom of the Lord of
Spirits has revealed him to the Holy and
the righteous, for he has kept safe the lot
of the righteous, for they have hated and
rejected this world of iniquity. And all
its works and its ways they have hated
in the name of the Lord of Spirits. For
in His name they are saved and he is the
one who will require their lives.
17
48.8 And in those days the kings of the
Earth, and the strong who possess the
dry ground, will have downcast faces
because of the works of their hands, for
on the day of their distress and trouble
they will not save themselves.
48.9 And I will give them into the hands
of my chosen ones; like straw in the
fire, and like lead in water, so they will
burn in front of the righteous, and sink
in front of the Holy, and no trace will be
found of them.
48.10 And on the day of their trouble
there will be rest on the earth and they
will fall down in front of him and will
not rise. And there will be no one who
will take them with his hands and raise
them for they denied the Lord of Spirits
and his Messiah. May the name of the
Lord of Spirits be blessed!
49.1 For wisdom has been poured
out like water and glory will not fail in
front of Him forever and ever.
49.2 For He is powerful in all the
secrets of righteousness and iniquity
will pass away like a shadow, and will
have no existence; for the Chosen One
stands in front of the Lord of Spirits and
His Glory is for ever and ever, and His
Power for all generations.
49.3 And in Him dwell the spirit of
wisdom, and the spirit that gives
understanding, and the spirit of
knowledge and of power, and the spirit
of those who sleep in righteousness.
49.4 And he will judge the things that
are secret, and no one will be able to say
an idle word in front of him, for he has
been chosen in front of the Lord of
Spirits, in accordance with His wish.
50.1 And in those days a change will
occur for the Holy and the chosen; the
Light of Days will rest upon them, and
glory and honour will return to the
Holy.
50.2 And on the day of trouble,
calamity will be heaped up over the
sinners, but the righteous will conquer
in the Name of the Lord of Spirits and
He will show this to others so that they
might repent and abandon the works of
their hands.
50.3 And they will have no honour in
front of the Lord of Spirits, but in His
Name they will be saved and the Lord
of Spirits will have mercy on them, for
his mercy is great.
50.4 And He is righteous in His
judgment, and in front of His Glory
iniquity will not be able to stand against
His Judgment; he who does not repent
will be destroyed.
50.5 "And from then on I will not have
mercy on them," says the Lord of
Spirits.
51.1 And in those days the Earth will
return that which has been entrusted to
it, and Sheol will return that which has
been entrusted to it and that which it has
received. And destruction will return
what it owes.
51.2 And He will choose the Righteous
and the Holy from among them; for the
day has come near when they must be
saved.
51.3 And in those days, the Chosen One
will sit on his throne, and all the Secrets
of Wisdom will flow out from the
council of his mouth, for the Lord of
Spirits has appointed him and glorified
him.
51.4 And in those days the mountains
will leap like rams, and the hills will
skip like lambs satisfied with milk, and
all will become Angels in Heaven.
51.5 Their faces will shine with joy, for
in those days the Chosen One will have
risen and the earth will rejoice. And the
righteous will dwell upon it and the
chosen will walk upon it.
52.1 And after those days, in that
place where I had seen all the visions of
that which is secret, for I had been
carried off by a whirlwind, and they had
18
brought me to the west.
52.2 There my eyes saw the secrets of
Heaven; everything that will occur on
Earth: a mountain of iron, and a
mountain of copper, and a mountain of
silver, and a mountain of gold, and a
mountain of soft metal, and a mountain
of lead.
52.3 And I asked the Angel who went
with me, saying:
"What are these things which I have
seen in secret?"
52.4 And he said to me: "All these
things which you have seen serve the
authority of His Messiah, so that he may
be strong and powerful on the Earth."
52.5 And that Angel of Peace answered
me, saying: "Wait a little and you will
see, and everything which is secret,
which the Lord of Spirits has
established, will be revealed to you.
52.6 And these mountains, that you
have seen; the mountain of iron, and the
mountain of copper, and the mountain
of silver, and the mountain of gold, and
the mountain of soft metal, and the
mountain of lead. All these in front of
the Chosen One will be like wax before
fire, and like the water that comes down
from above onto these mountains they
will be weak under his feet.
52.7 And it will come to pass in those
days, that neither by gold, nor by silver,
will men save themselves; they will be
unable to save themselves, or to flee.
52.8 And there will be neither iron for
war nor material for a breastplate;
bronze will be no use, and tin will be of
no use and will count for nothing, and
lead will not be wanted.
52.9 All these will be wiped out and
destroyed from the face of the earth
when the Chosen One appears in front
of the Lord of Spirits."
53.1 And there my eyes saw a deep
valley, and its mouth was open; and all
those who dwell upon dry ground and
the sea and the islands will bring gifts
and presents and offerings to him, but
that deep valley will not become full.
53.2 And their hands commit evil, and
everything at which the righteous toil
the sinners evilly devour; and so the
sinners will be destroyed from in front
of the Lord of Spirits, and will be
banished from the face of His Earth,
unceasingly for ever and ever.
53.3 For I saw the Angels of
Punishment going and preparing all the
instruments of Satan.
53.4 And I asked the Angel of Peace,
who went with me, and I said to him:
"These instruments - for whom are they
preparing them?"
53.5 And he said to me: "They are
preparing these for the kings and the
powerful of this Earth, so that by means
of them they may be destroyed.
53.6 And after this the Righteous and
Chosen One will cause the house of his
congregation to appear; from then on, in
the name of the Lord of Spirits, they
will not be hindered.
53.7 And in front of him these
mountains will not be firm like the
earth, and the hills will be like a spring
of water; and the righteous will have
rest from the ill-treatment of the
sinners."
54.1 And I looked, and turned to
another part of the Earth, and I saw
there a deep valley with burning fire.
54.2 And they brought the kings and
powerful and threw them into that
valley.
54.3 And there my eyes saw how they
made instruments for them - iron chains
of immeasurable weight.
54.4 And I asked the Angel of Peace,
who went with me, saying: "These
chain instruments - for whom are they
being prepared?"
54.5 And he said to me: "These are
being prepared for the hosts of Azazel,
so that they may take them, and throw
them into the lowest part of hell; and
they will cover their jaws with rough
stones, as the Lord of Spirits
19
commanded.
54.6 And Michael and Gabriel, Raphael
and Phanuel - these will take hold of
them on that great day. And throw
them, on that day, into the furnace of
burning fire, so that the Lord of Spirits
may take vengeance on them for their
iniquity, in that they became servants of
Satan, and led astray those who dwell
upon the dry ground.
54.7 And in those days, the punishment
of the Lord of Spirits will go out, and all
the storehouses of the waters which are
above the sky and under the earth, will
be opened.
54.8 And all the waters will be joined
with the waters that are above the sky.
The water that is above the sky is male
and the water that is under the Earth is
female.
54.9 And all those who dwell upon the
dry ground, and those who dwell under
the ends of Heaven, will be wiped out.
54.10 And because of this they will
acknowledge their iniquity which they
have committed on the Earth and
through this they will be destroyed."
55.1 And after this, the Head of
Days repented, and said:
"I have destroyed to no purpose all
those who dwell upon the dry ground."
55.2 And he swore by His Great Name:
"From now on I will not act like this
towards all those who dwell upon the
dry ground. And I will put a sign in
Heaven, and it will be a pledge of faith
between me and them forever, so long
as Heaven is above the Earth.
55.3 And this will be in accordance with
my command. When I want to take
hold of them with the hands of the
Angels, on the day of distress and pain,
in the face of my anger and my wrath,
my wrath and anger will remain upon
them" says the Lord, The Lord of
Spirits.
55.4 "You powerful kings who dwell
upon the dry ground will be obliged to
watch my Chosen One sit down on the
throne of My Glory, and judge, in the
Name of the Lord of Spirits, Azazel and
all his associates and all his hosts."
56.1 And I saw there the hosts of the
Angels of Punishment, as they went,
and they were holding chains of iron
and bronze.
56.2 And I asked the Angel of Peace,
who went with me, saying:
"To whom are those who are holding
the chains going?"
56.3 And he said to me: "Each to his
own chosen ones, and to their beloved
ones, so that they may be thrown into
the chasm, in the depths of the valley."
56.4 And then, that valley will be filled
with their chosen and beloved ones, and
the days of their life will be at an end,
and the days of their leading astray will
no longer be counted.
56.5 And in those days, the Angels will
gather together, and will throw
themselves towards the east, upon the
Parthians and Medes. They will stir up
the kings so that a disturbing spirit will
come upon them, and they will drive
them from their thrones; and they will
come out like lions from their lairs, and
like hungry wolves in the middle of
their flocks.
56.6 And they will go up and trample
on the Land of My Chosen Ones, and
the land of my chosen ones will become
before them a tramping-ground and a
beaten track.
56.7 But the City of My Righteous Ones
will be a hindrance to their horses, and
they will stir up slaughter amongst
themselves, and their own right hand
will be strong against them. And a man
will not admit to knowing his
neighbour, or his brother, nor a son his
father, or his mother, until, through their
death, there are corpses enough; and
their punishment - it will not be in vain.
56.8 And in those days Sheol will open
its mouth and they will sink into it and
their destruction; Sheol will swallow up
the sinners in front of the faces of the
20
chosen."
57.1 And it came to pass, after this,
that I saw another host of chariots with
men riding on them, and they came
upon the wind from the east and from
the west, to the south.
57.2 And the sound of the noise of their
chariots was heard. And when this
occurred the Holy Ones observed it
from Heaven and the Pillars of the Earth
were shaken from their foundations.
And the sound was heard from the ends
of the Earth to the ends of Heaven
throughout one day.
57.3 And all will fall down and worship
the Lord of Spirits. And this is the end
of the second parable.
58.1 And I began to speak The
Third Parable. About The Righteous
and about The Chosen.
58.2 Blessed are you, the righteous and
the chosen, for your lot will be glorious!
58.3 And the righteous will be in the
light of the Sun and the chosen in the
light of eternal life. And there will be
no end to the days of their life and the
days of the Holy will be without
number.
58.4 And they will seek the light and
will find righteousness with the Lord of
Spirits. Peace be to the righteous with
the Lord of the World!
58.5 And after this it will be said to the
Holy that they should seek in Heaven
the secrets of righteousness, the lot of
faith; for it has become bright as the
Sun upon the dry ground, and darkness
has passed away.
58.6 And there will be ceaseless light,
and to a limit of days, they will not
come, for darkness will have been
destroyed previously. And the light will
endure in front of the Lord of Spirits,
and the light of uprightness will endure
in front of the Lord of Spirits, forever.
59.1 And in those days my eyes saw
the secrets of the flashes of lightning,
and the lights, and the regulations
governing them; and they flash for a
blessing or a curse, as the Lord of
Spirits wishes.
59.2 And there I saw the secrets of the
thunder and how when it crashes in
Heaven above the sound of it is heard.
And they showed me the dwellings of
the dry ground, and the sound of the
thunder, for peace, and for blessing, or
for a curse, according to the word of the
Lord of Spirits.
59.3 And after this all the secrets of the
lights, and of the flashes of lightning,
were shown to me. They flash to bring
blessing and satisfaction.
60.1 In the fiftieth year, in the
seventh month, on the fourteenth day of
the month of the life of Enoch. In that
parable, I saw how the Heaven of
Heavens was shaken violently, and the
Host of the Most High and the Angels, a
thousand thousands and ten thousand
times ten thousand, were extremely
disturbed.
60.2 And then I saw the Head of Days
sitting on the throne of his glory and the
Angels and righteous were sitting
around him.
60.3 And a great trembling seized me,
and fear took hold of me, and my loins
collapsed and gave way, and my whole
being melted, and I fell upon my face.
60.4 And the Holy Michael sent another
Holy Angel, one of the Holy Angels,
and he raised me; and when he raised
me my spirit returned, for I had been
unable to endure the sight of that host,
and the disturbance, and the shaking of
Heaven.
60.5 And the Holy Michael said to me:
“What sight has disturbed you like this?
Until today has the day of His mercy
lasted and He has been merciful and
long suffering towards those who dwell
21
upon the dry ground.
60.6 And when the Day, and the Power,
and the Punishment, and the Judgment
come that the Lord of Spirits has
prepared for those who worship the
Righteous Judgment, and for those who
deny the Righteous Judgment, and for
those who take His name in vain - and
that Day has been prepared. For the
chosen a covenant, but for the sinners a
visitation.”
60.7 And on that day two monsters will
be separated from one another, a female
monster whose name is Leviathan, to
dwell in the depths of the sea, above the
springs of the waters.
60.8 And the name of the male is
Behemoth who occupies with his breast
an immense desert named Dendayn on
the east of the Garden where the chosen
and the righteous dwell. Where my
great-grandfather was received, who
was seventh from Adam, the first man
whom the Lord of Spirits made.
60.9 And I asked that other Angel to
show me the power of those monsters,
how they were separated on one day,
and thrown, one into the depths of the
sea and the other on to the dry ground of
the desert.
60.10 And he said to me: “Son of man,
you here wish to know what is secret.”
60.11 And the other Angel spoke to me,
the one who went with me and showed
me what is secret; what is first and last
in Heaven, in the heights, and under the
dry ground, in the depths, and at the
Ends of Heaven, and at the Foundations
of Heaven, and in the Storehouses of the
Winds.
60.12 And how the spirits are
distributed, and how they are weighed.
And how the springs, and the winds, are
counted according to the power of their
spirit. And the power of the light of the
Moon. And the divisions of the stars
according to their names. And how all
the divisions are made.
60.13 And the thunder - according to
the places were it falls. And all the
divisions that are made in lightning - so
that it may flash. And its hosts - how
they quickly obey.
60.14 For the thunder have fixed
intervals, which have been given to its
sound, for waiting. And the thunder
and the lightning are not separate
although not the same. Through a spirit
the two of them move inseparably.
60.15 For when the lightning flashes the
thunder utters its voice, and the spirit, at
the proper time, causes it to rest, and
divides equally between them because
the storehouse of the times for their
occurrence is like that of the sand. And
each of them, at the proper time, is held
by a rein, and turned back by the power
of the spirit, and likewise driven
forward, according to the number of the
regions of the Earth.
60.16 And the spirit of the sea is male
and strong, and according to the power
of its strength, the spirit turns it back
with a rein, and likewise it is driven
forward, and scattered amongst all the
mountains of the Earth.
60.17 And the spirit of the hoarfrost is
its own Angel; and the spirit of the hail,
is a good Angel.
60.18 And the spirit of the snow has
withdrawn because of its power, and it
has a special spirit, and that which rises
from it is like smoke and its name is
frost.
60.19 And the spirit of the mist is not
associated with them in their storehouse
but has a special storehouse; for its
course is glorious both in light and
darkness, and in winter and in summer,
and its storehouse is an Angel.
60.20 The spirit of the dew has its
dwelling at the ends of Heaven and is
connected with the storehouses of the
rain. And its course is in winter and in
summer and its clouds. And the clouds
of the mist are associated and one gives
to the other.
60.21 And when the spirit of the rain
moves from its storehouse the Angels
come and open the storehouse and bring
22
it out. And when it is scattered over all
the dry ground it joins with all the water
that is on the dry ground. And
whenever it joins with the water that is
on the dry ground.(.…..)
60.22 For the waters are for those who
dwell upon the dry ground, for they are
nourishment for the dry ground, from
the Most High who is in Heaven.
Therefore there is a fixed measure for
the rain and the Angels comprehend it.
60.23 All these things, I saw towards
the Garden of Righteousness.
60.24 And the Angel of Peace who was
with me, said to me: “These two
monsters, prepared in accordance with
the greatness of the Lord, will feed them
that Punishment of the Lord. And
children will be killed with their
mothers and sons with their fathers.
60.25 When the punishment of the Lord
of Spirits rests upon them it will remain
resting so that the punishment of the
Lord of Spirits may not come in vain
upon these. Afterwards, the judgment
will be according to His mercy and His
patience."
61.1 And in those days, I saw long
cords given to those Angels and they
acquired wings for themselves, and
flew, and went towards the north.
61.2 And I asked the Angel, saying:
“Why did these take the long cords, and
go?” And he said to me: “They went
so that they may measure.”
61.3 And the Angel who went with me,
said to me:
“These will bring the measurements of
the righteous, and the ropes of the
righteous, to the righteous, that they
may rely on the name of the Lord of
Spirits for ever and ever.
61.4 The chosen will begin to dwell
with the chosen, and these
measurements will be given to faith, and
will strengthen righteousness.
61.5 And these measurements will
reveal all the secrets of the depths of the
Earth, and those who were destroyed by
the desert, and those who were
devoured by the fish of the sea, and by
animals, that they may return and rely
on the Day of the Chosen One. For no
one will be destroyed in front of the
Lord of Spirits, and no one can be
destroyed.”
61.6 And all those in the Heavens above
received a command, and power, and
one voice, and one light like fire was
given to them.
61.7 And Him, before everything, they
blessed, and exalted, and praised in
wisdom. And they showed themselves
wise in speech and in the spirit of life.
61.8 And the Lord of Spirits set the
Chosen One on the throne of his glory,
and he will judge all the works of the
Holy ones in Heaven above, and in the
Balance he will weigh their deeds.
61.9 And when he lifts his face to judge
their secret ways according to the word
of the name of the Lord of Spirits, and
their path according to the way of the
Righteous Judgment of the Lord Most
High, they will all speak with one voice
and bless, and praise, and exalt, and
glorify, the Name of the Lord of Spirits.
61.10 And he will call all the Host of
the Heavens and all the Holy Ones
above, and the Host of the Lord, the
Cherubim, and the Seraphim, and the
Ophannim, and all the Angels of Power,
and all the Angels of the Principalities,
and the Chosen One, and the other host
that is upon the dry ground, and over
the water, on that Day.
61.11 And they will raise one voice, and
will bless, and praise, and glorify, and
exalt, in the spirit of faith, and in the
spirit of wisdom, and of patience, and in
the spirit of mercy, and in the spirit of
justice, and of peace, and in the spirit of
goodness. And they will all say with
one voice: “Blessed is He, and blessed
be the name of the Lord of Spirits for
ever and ever.”
61.12 All Those Who Do Not Sleep in
Heaven above will bless him. All His
Holy Ones who are in Heaven, will
23
bless Him, and all the chosen ones who
dwell in the Garden of Life, and every
spirit able to bless, and praise and exalt,
and hallow your Holy Name. And all
flesh which to the limit of its power,
will praise, and bless, your Name
forever and ever.
61.13 For great is the mercy of the Lord
of Spirits, and he is long-suffering; and
all his works and all his forces, as many
as he has made, he has revealed to the
righteous and the chosen, in the Name
of the Lord of Spirits.
62.1 And thus the Lord commanded
the kings, and the mighty and the
exalted, and those who dwell upon the
earth, and said: “Open your eyes and
raise your horns if you are able to
acknowledge the Chosen One.”
62.2 And the Lord of Spirits sat on His
Throne of Glory, and the spirit of
righteousness was poured out on him,
and the word of his mouth kills all the
sinners and all the lawless, and they are
destroyed in front of him.
62.3 And on that Day, all the kings and
the mighty and the exalted, and those
who possess the earth, will stand up and
they will see and recognize how he sits
on the Throne of His Glory. And the
righteous are judged in righteousness, in
front of him, and no idle word is spoken
in front of him.
62.4 And pain will come upon them as
upon a woman in labour, for whom
giving birth is difficult when her child
enters the mouth of the womb, and she
has difficulty giving birth.
62.5 And one half of them will look at
the other, and they will be terrified, and
will cast down their faces, and pain will
take hold of them when they see that
son of a woman sitting on the throne of
His Glory.
62.6 And the mighty kings, and all
those who possess the earth, will praise
and bless and exalt Him who rules
everything that is hidden.
62.7 For from the beginning that Son of
Man was hidden, and the Most High
kept him in the presence of His power,
and revealed him only to the chosen.
62.8 And the community of the Holy
and the chosen will be sown and all the
chosen will stand before him on that
day.
62.9 And all the mighty kings, and the
exalted, and those who rule the dry
ground, will fall down before him, on
their faces, and worship; and they will
set their hopes on that Son of Man, and
will entreat him, and will petition for
mercy from him.
62.10 But the Lord of Spirits will then
so press them that they will hasten to go
out from before Him, and their faces
will be filled with shame, and the
darkness will grow deeper on their
faces.
62.11 And the Angels of Punishment
will take them so that they may repay
them for the wrong that they did to His
children and to His chosen ones.
62.12 And they will become a spectacle
to the righteous and to His chosen ones;
they will rejoice over them, for the
anger of the Lord of Spirits will rest
upon them, and the sword of the Lord of
Spirits will be drunk with them.
62.13 And the righteous and the chosen
will be saved on that Day and they will
never see the faces of the sinners and
the lawless from then on.
62.14 And the Lord of Spirits will
remain over them and with that Son of
Man they will dwell, and eat, and lie
down, and rise up, forever and ever.
62.15 And the righteous and chosen will
have risen from the earth, and will have
ceased to cast down their faces, and will
have put on the Garment of Life.
62.16 And this will be a Garment of
Life from the Lord of Spirits; and your
garments will not wear out, and your
glory will not fail, in front of the Lord
of Spirits.
63.1 In those days, the mighty kings
who possess the dry ground will entreat
24
the Angels of His Punishment to whom
they have been handed over so that they
might give them a little respite. And so
that they might fall down and worship
in front of the Lord of Spirits, and
confess their sins in front of Him.
63.2 And they will bless and praise the
Lord of Spirits, and say: “Blessed be
the Lord of Spirits, and the Lord of
Kings, the Lord of the Mighty, and the
Lord of the Rich, and the Lord of Glory,
and the Lord of Wisdom!
63.3 And everything secret is clear, in
front of You, and your power is for all
generations, and your glory is forever
and ever. Deep and without number are
all your secrets and your righteousness
is beyond reckoning.
63.4 Now we realize that we ought to
praise and bless the Lord of Kings and
the one who is King over all Kings.”
63.5 And they will say: “Would that we
might be given a respite, so that we
might praise and thank and bless him,
and make our confession in front of His
Glory.
63.6 And now we long for a respite, but
do not find it; we are driven off and do
not obtain it; and the light has passed
away from before us, and darkness will
be our dwelling forever and ever.
63.7 For we have not made our
confession before him, and we have not
praised the name of the Lord of Kings,
and we have not praised the Lord for all
his works, but our hopes have been on
the sceptre of our kingdom, and of our
glory.
63.8 And on the day of our affliction
and distress he does not save us, and we
find no respite to make our confession
that our Lord is faithful in all his
doings, and in all his judgments and his
justice, and that his judgments show no
respect for persons.
63.9 And we pass away from in front of
him because of all our works and all our
sins have been counted exactly.”
63.10 Then they will say to them: “Our
souls are sated with possessions gained
through iniquity, but they do not
prevent our going down into the flames
of the torment of Sheol.”
63.11 And after this their faces will be
filled with darkness and shame, in front
of that Son of Man, and they will be
driven away from him. And the sword
will dwell among them - in front of
Him.
63.12 And thus says the Lord of Spirits:
“This is the Law and the Judgment for
the mighty, and the kings, and the
exalted, and for those who possess the
dry ground, in front of the Lord of
Spirits.”
64.1 And I saw other figures hidden
in that place.
64.2 I heard the voice of the Angel
saying: “These are the Angels who
came down from Heaven onto the Earth
and revealed what is secret to the sons
of men, and led astray the sons of men,
so that they committed sin.”
65.1 And in those days, Noah saw
the Earth had tilted and that its
destruction was near.
65.2 And he set off from there and went
to the ends of the Earth and cried out to
his great-grandfather Enoch; and Noah
said three times in a bitter voice: "Hear
me, hear me, hear me!"
65.3 And he said to him: "Tell me,
what is it that is being done on the
Earth, that the Earth is so afflicted and
shaken, lest I be destroyed with it!"
65.4 And immediately there was a great
disturbance on the Earth and a voice
was heard from Heaven and I fell upon
my face.
65.5 And my great-grandfather Enoch
came, stood by me, and said to me:
"Why did you cry out to me, with such
bitter crying and weeping?
65.6 And a command has gone out from
the Lord against those who dwell upon
the dry ground that this must be their
25
end. For they have learnt all the secrets
of the Angels, and all the wrongdoings
of the satans, and all their secret power,
and all the power of those who practice
magic arts, and the power of
enchantments, and the power of those
who cast molten images for all the
Earth.
65.7 And further, how silver is
produced from the dust of the earth and
how soft metal occurs on the earth.
65.8 For lead and tin are not produced
from the earth, like the former; there is a
spring which produces them, and an
Angel who stands in it, and that Angel
distributes them."
65.9 And after this, my greatgrandfather Enoch took hold of me with
his hand, and raised me, and said to me:
"Go, for I have asked the Lord of Spirits
about this disturbance on the earth."
65.10 And he said to me: “Because of
their iniquity, their judgment has been
completed, and they will no longer be
counted before me; because of the
sorceries they have searched out and
learnt, the Earth and those who dwell
upon it will be destroyed.
65.11 And for these, there will be no
place of refuge, for ever, for they
showed to them what is secret, and they
have been condemned; but not so for
you, my son; the Lord of Spirits knows
that you are pure and innocent of this
reproach concerning the secrets.
65.12 And he has established your name
among the Holy, and will keep you
from amongst those who dwell upon the
dry ground; and he has destined your
offspring in righteousness, to be kings,
and for great honours. And from your
offspring will flow out a spring of the
Righteous and Holy, without number
forever.”
66.1 And after this, he showed me
the Angels of Punishment, who were
ready to come and release all the forces
of the water, which is under the earth, in
order to bring judgment and destruction
on all those who reside and dwell upon
the dry ground.
66.2 And the Lord of Spirits
commanded the Angels who were
coming out, not to raise their hands, but
to keep watch; for those Angels were in
charge of the forces of the waters.
66.3 And I came out from before Enoch.
67.1 And in those days, the word of
the Lord came to me, and he said to me:
"Noah, behold; your lot has come up
before me, a lot without reproach, a lot
of love and uprightness.
67.2 And now the Angels are making a
wooden structure, and when the Angels
come out from that task, I will put my
hand on it, and keep it safe. And a
change shall take place so that the dry
ground may not remain empty.
67.3 And I will establish your offspring
before me, forever and ever, and I will
scatter those who dwell with you, over
the face of the dry ground. I will not
again put them to the test, on the face of
the Earth, but they will be blessed and
increase on the dry ground in the name
of the Lord."
67.4 And they will shut up those
Angels, who showed iniquity, in that
burning valley, which my greatgrandfather Enoch had shown to me
previously, in the west, near the
mountains of gold and silver and iron
and soft metal and tin.
67.5 And I saw that valley, in which
there was a great disturbance, and a
heaving of the waters.
67.6 And when all this happened, from
the fiery molten metal, and the
disturbance, which disturbed the waters
in that place, a smell of sulphur was
produced, and it was associated with
those waters. And that valley of the
Angels, who led men astray, burns
under the ground.
67.7 And through the valleys of that
same area, flow out rivers of fire where
those Angels will be punished, who led
astray those on the dry ground.
26
67.8 And in those days, those waters
will serve the kings, and the mighty,
and the exalted, and those who dwell
upon dry ground, for the healing of soul
and body, but also for the punishment of
the spirit. And their spirits are so full of
lust that they will be punished in their
bodies, for they denied the Lord of
Spirits. And they see their punishment
every day yet they do not believe in His
Name.
67.9 And the more their bodies are
burnt, the more a change will come over
their spirits, for ever and ever; for no
one can speak an idle word in front of
the Lord of Spirits.
67.10 For judgment will come upon
them, for they believe in the lust of their
bodies, but deny the spirit of the Lord.
67.11 And those same waters will
undergo a change in those days; for
when those Angels are punished in
those days, the temperature of those
springs of water will change, and when
the Angels come up, that water of the
springs will change, and become cold.
67.12 And I heard the Holy Michael
answering and saying: "This judgment,
with which the Angels are judged, is a
testimony for the kings and the mighty
who possess the dry ground.
67.13 For these waters of judgment
serve for the healing of the bodies of the
kings, and for the lust of their bodies;
but they do not see, and do not believe,
that these waters will change, and will
become a fire which burns forever."
68.1 And after this, my greatgrandfather Enoch gave me the
explanation of all the secrets, in a book,
and the parables that had been given to
him; and he put them together for me, in
the words of the Book of Parables.
68.2 And on that day the Holy Michael
answered Raphael, saying: “The power
of the spirit seizes me and makes me
tremble because of the harshness of the
judgment of the Angels. Who can
endure the harshness of the judgment
which has been executed and before
which they melt with fear?”
68.3 And the Holy Michael answered
Raphael again, and said to him: “Who
would not soften his heart over it, and
whose mind would not be disturbed by
this word? Judgment has gone out
against them, upon those whom they
have led out like this.”
68.4 But it came to pass, when he stood
before the Lord of Spirits, that the Holy
Michael spoke as follows to Raphael:
“I will not take their part under the eye
of the Lord, for the Lord of Spirits is
angry with them, because they act as if
they were the Lord.
68.5 Because of this the hidden
judgment will come upon them for ever
and ever; for neither any other Angel,
nor any man, will receive their lot, but
they alone have received their judgment
for ever and ever.
69.1 And after this judgment I will
terrify them, and make them tremble,
for they have shown this to those who
dwell upon the dry ground.”
69.2 And behold, the names of those
Angels: - The first of them is Semyaza
(Azza), and the second Artaqifa, and
the third Armen, and the fourth
Kokabiel, and the fifth Turiel, and the
sixth Ramiel, and the seventh Daniel,
and the eighth Nuqael, and the ninth
Baraqiel, and the tenth Azazel, and the
eleventh Armaros, the twelfth Batriel,
the thirteenth Basasael, the fourteenth
Ananel, the fifteenth Turiel, the
sixteenth Samsiel, the seventeenth
Yetarel, the eighteenth Tumiel, the
nineteenth Turiel, the twentieth
Rumiel, the twenty-first Azazel.
69.3 And these are the chiefs of their
Angels, and the names of the leaders of
hundreds, and their leaders of fifties,
and their leaders of tens.
69.4 The name of the first is Yequn; this
is the one who led astray all the children
of the Holy Angels, and he brought
them down onto the dry ground, and led
27
them astray through the daughters of
men.
69.5 And the name of the second is
Asbeel; this one suggested an evil plan
to the children of the Holy Angels, and
led them astray, so that they corrupted
their bodies with the daughters of men.
69.6 And the name of the third is
Gadreel; this is the one that showed all
the deadly blows to the sons of men.
And he led astray Eve. And he showed
the weapons of death to the children of
men, the shield and the breastplate, and
the sword for slaughter, and all the
weapons of death to the sons of men.
69.7 And from his hand they have gone
out against those who dwell the dry
ground from that time and forever and
ever.
69.8 And the name of the fourth is
Penemue; this one showed the sons of
men the bitter and the sweet and showed
them all the secrets of their wisdom.
69.9 He taught men the art of writing
with ink and paper, and through this
many have gone astray, from eternity to
eternity, and to this day.
69.10 For men were not created for this,
that they should confirm their faith like
this, with pen and ink.
69.11 For men were created no
differently from the Angels, so that they
might remain righteous and pure, and
death, which destroys everything, would
not have touched them; but through this
knowledge of theirs they are being
destroyed and through this power death
consumes them.
69.12 And the name of the fifth is
Kasdeyae; this one showed the sons of
men all the evil blows of the spirits and
of the demons, and the blows that attack
the embryo in the womb so that it
miscarries. And the blows that attack
the soul: the bite of the serpent. And
the blows that occur at midday, and the
son of the serpent - who is strong.
69.13 And this is the task of Kesbeel,
the chief of the oath, who showed the
oath to the Holy ones when he dwelt on
high in glory. And his name is Beqa.
69.14 And this one told the Holy
Michael that he should show him the
secret name so that they might mention
it in the oath, so that those, who showed
the sons of men everything that is
secret, trembled before that name and
oath.
69.15 And this is the power of this oath,
for it is powerful and strong, and he
placed this oath, Akae, in the charge of
the Holy Michael.
69.16 And these are the secrets of this
oath, and they are strong through this
oath, and Heaven was suspended, before
the world was created, and forever.
69.17 And through it the earth was
founded upon the water, and from the
hidden recesses of the mountains come
beautiful waters, from the creation of
the world and for ever.
69.18 And through that oath the sea was
created, and as its foundation, for the
time of anger, he placed for it the sand,
and it does not go beyond it, from the
creation of the world and for ever.
69.19 And through that oath the deeps
were made firm, and they stand and do
not move from their place, from the
creation of the world and for ever.
69.20 And through that oath the Sun
and the Moon complete their course and
do not transgress their command, from
the creation of the world and for ever.
69.21 And through that oath the stars
complete their course, and he calls their
names, and they answer him, from the
creation of the world and for ever.
69.22 And likewise the spirits of the
water, of the winds, and of all the
breezes, and their paths, according to all
the groups of the spirits.
69.23 And there are kept the
storehouses of the sound of thunder, and
of the light of the lightning; and there
are kept the storehouses of the hail, and
the hoarfrost, and the storehouses of the
mist, and the storehouses of the rain and
dew.
69.24 And all these make their
28
confession and give thanks in front of
the Lord of Spirits and sing praises with
all their power. And their food consists
of all their thanksgiving and they give
thanks, praise, and exalt, in the name of
the Lord of Spirits, forever and ever.
69.25 And this oath is strong over them
and through it they are kept safe and
their courses are not disturbed.
69.26 And they had great joy and they
blessed, praised, and exalted, because
the name of that Son of Man had been
revealed to them.
69.27 And he sat on the Throne of His
Glory and the whole judgment was
given to the Son of Man and he will
cause the sinners to pass away and be
destroyed from the face of the Earth.
69.28 And those who led astray the
world will be bound in chains and will
be shut up in the assembly-place of their
destruction, and all their works will pass
away from the face of the earth.
69.29 And from then on there will be
nothing corruptible. For that Son of
Man has appeared, and has sat on the
Throne of His Glory, and everything
evil will pass away and go from in front
of Him; and the word of that Son of
Man will be strong in front of the Lord
of Spirits.
This is the Third Parable of Enoch.
70.1 And it came to pass, after this,
that while he was living his name was
lifted from those who dwell upon the
dry ground to the presence of that Son
of Man, and to the presence of the Lord
of Spirits.
70.2 And he was lifted on the chariots
of the spirit, and his name vanished
from among them.
70.3 And from that day I was not
counted among them, and He placed me
between two winds, between the north
and the west, where the Angels took the
cords to measure for me the place for
the chosen and the righteous.
70.4 And there I saw the First Fathers
and the righteous who from the
beginning of the world dwelt in that
place.
71.1 And it came to pass, after this,
that my spirit was carried off, and it
went up into the Heavens. I saw the
sons of the Holy Angels treading upon
flames of fire their garments were
white, and their clothing, and the light
of their face, was like snow.
71.2 And I saw two rivers of fire, and
the light of that fire shone like a
hyacinth, and I fell upon my face in
front of the Lord of Spirits.
71.3 And the Angel Michael, one of the
Archangels, took hold of me by my
right hand, and raised me and led me
out to all the secrets of mercy, and the
secrets of righteousness.
71.4 And he showed me all the secrets
of the Ends of Heaven and all the
Storehouses of the Stars and the Lights
from where they come out from below
the Holy Ones.
71.5 And the Spirit carried Enoch off to
the Highest Heaven, and I saw there, in
the middle of that Light, something
built of crystal stones, and in the middle
of those stones tongues of living fire.
71.6 And my spirit saw a circle of fire,
which surrounded that house; from its
four sides came rivers, full of living fire,
and they surrounded that house.
71.7 And round about were the
Seraphim and the Cherubim, and the
Ophannim; these are They Who Do Not
Sleep but keep watch over the Throne of
His Glory.
71.8 And I saw Angels, who could not
be counted, a thousand thousands and
ten thousand times ten thousand,
surrounding that house. And Michael,
and Raphael, and Gabriel, and Phanuel,
and the Holy Angels who are in the
Heavens above, went in and out of that
house.
71.9 And Michael, and Raphael, and
Gabriel, and Phanuel, and many Holy
Angels without number, came out from
29
that house.
71.10 And with them the Head of Days,
his head white, and pure, like wool and
his garments - indescribable.
71.11 And I fell upon my face, and my
whole body melted, and my spirit was
transformed; and I cried out in a loud
voice, in the spirit of power, and I
blessed, praised, and exalted.
71.12 And these blessings, which came
out from my mouth, were pleasing
before that Head of Days.
71.13 And that Head of Days came with
Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Phanuel,
and thousands and tens of thousands of
Angels without number.
71.14 And that Angel, came to me, and
greeted me with his voice, and said to
me: “You are the son of man who was
born to righteousness and righteousness
remains over you and the righteousness
of the Head of Days, will not leave
you.”
71.15 And he said to me: “He
proclaims peace to you in the name of
the world which is to come, for from
there peace has come out from the
creation of the world and so you will
have it for ever and for ever and ever.
71.16 And all will walk according to
your way, inasmuch as righteousness
will never leave you. With you will be
their dwelling, and with you their lot,
and they will not be separated from you
for ever and for ever and ever.
71.17 And so there will be length of
days with that Son of Man, and the
righteous will have peace, and the
righteous will have an upright way in
the name of the Lord of Spirits, for ever
and ever.”
Section I I I. Chapters LXXIILXXXII
The Book of the Heavenly
Luminaries
72.1 The Book of the Revolutions
of the Lights of Heaven.
Each as it is; according to their classes,
according to their period of rule and
their times, according to their names
and places of origin, and according to
their months. That Uriel, the Holy
Angel who was with me, and is their
leader, showed to me. And he showed
me all their regulations, exactly as they
are, for each year of the world and for
ever, until the new creation shall be
made which will last forever.
72.2 And this is the First Law of the
Lights. The light called the Sun; its
rising is in the Gates of Heaven that are
towards the east, and its setting is in the
western Gates of Heaven.
72.3 And I saw six Gates from which
the Sun rises, and six Gates in which the
Sun sets, and the Moon also rises and
sets in those Gates, and the leaders of
the stars together with those whom they
lead. There are six in the east and six in
the west, all exactly in place, one next
to the other; and there are many
windows to the south and the north of
those Gates.
72.4 And first there rises the greater
light, named the Sun, and its disc is like
the disc of Heaven, and the whole of it
is full of a fire which gives light and
warmth.
72.5 The wind blows the chariots on
which it ascends, and the Sun goes
down in the sky and returns through the
north in order to reach the east, and is
led so that it comes to the appropriate
Gate and shines in the sky.
72.6 In this way it rises in the first
30
month, in the large Gate, namely; it
rises through the fourth of those six
Gates that are towards the east.
72.7 And in that fourth Gate, through
which the Sun rises in the first month,
there are twelve window-openings from
which, whenever they are opened,
flames come out.
72.8 When the Sun rises in Heaven it
goes out through that fourth Gate for
thirty days, and exactly in the fourth
Gate, in the west of Heaven, it goes
down.
72.9 And in those days the day grows
daily longer, and the night grows
nightly shorter, until the thirtieth
morning.
72.10 And on that day the day becomes
longer than the night by a double part,
and the day amounts to exactly ten
parts, and the night amounts to eight
parts.
72.11 And the Sun rises from that fourth
Gate, and sets in the fourth Gate, and
returns to the fifth Gate in the east for
thirty mornings; and it rises from it and
sets in the fifth Gate.
72.12 And then the day becomes longer
by two parts, and the day amounts to
eleven parts, and the night becomes
shorter and amounts to seven parts.
72.13 And the Sun returns to the east
and comes to the sixth Gate, and rises
and sets in the sixth Gate for thirty-one
mornings, because of its sign.
72.14 And on that day the day becomes
longer than the night, and the day
becomes double the night; and the day
amounts to twelve parts, and the night
becomes shorter and amounts to six
parts.
72.15 And the Sun rises up so that the
day may grow shorter, and the night
longer; and the Sun returns to the east,
and comes to the sixth Gate, and rises
from it, and sets, for thirty mornings.
72.16 And when thirty mornings have
been completed the day becomes
shorter, by exactly one part; and the day
amounts to eleven parts, and the night to
seven parts.
72.17 And the Sun goes out from the
west, through that sixth Gate, and goes
to the east, and rises in the fifth Gate for
thirty mornings and it sets in the west
again, in the fifth Gate in the west.
72.18 On that day the day becomes
shorter by two parts, and the day
amounts to ten parts, and the night to
eight parts.
72.19 And the Sun rises from that fifth
Gate, and sets in the fifth Gate in the
west, and rises in the fourth Gate for
thirty-one mornings because of its sign,
and sets in the west.
72.20 On that day the day becomes
equal with the night, and is of equal
length; and the night amounts to nine
parts, and the day to nine parts.
72.21 And the Sun rises from that Gate
and sets in the west, and returns to the
east, and rises in the third Gate for thirty
mornings, and sets in the west in the
third Gate.
72.22 And the Sun rises from that third
Gate, and sets in the third Gate in the
west, and returns to the east; and the
Sun rises in the second Gate in the east
for thirty mornings, and likewise, it sets
in the second Gate, in the west of
Heaven.
72.24 And on that day the night
amounts to eleven parts and the day to
seven parts.
72.25 And the Sun rises, on that day,
from the second Gate, and sets in the
west in the second Gate, and returns to
the east to the first Gate for thirty-one
mornings, then sets in the west in the
first Gate.
72.26 And on that day the night
becomes longer, and becomes double
the day; and the night amounts to
exactly twelve parts, and the day to six
parts.
72.27 And with this, the Sun has
completed the divisions of its journey,
and it turns back again, along these
divisions of its journey; and it comes
through that first Gate for thirty
31
mornings, and sets in the west opposite
it.
72.28 And on that day the night
becomes shorter in length by one part,
and amounts to eleven parts, and the
day to seven parts.
72.29 And the Sun returns, and comes
to the second Gate in the east, and it
returns along those divisions of its
journey for thirty mornings, rising and
setting.
72.30 And on that day the night
becomes shorter in length and the night
amounts to ten parts and the day to eight
parts.
72.31 And on that day, the Sun rises
from the second Gate, and sets in the
west, and returns to the east, and rises in
the third Gate for thirty one mornings,
and sets in the west of the sky.
72.32 And on that day the night
becomes shorter, and amounts to nine
parts, and the day amounts to nine parts,
and the night becomes equal with the
day. And the year amounts to exactly
364 days.
72.33 And the length of the day and the
night, and the shortness of the day and
the night - they are different because of
the journey of the Sun.
72.34 Because of it, its journey becomes
daily longer, and nightly shorter.
72.35 And this is the law and the
journey of the Sun and its return, as
often as it returns; sixty times it returns
and rises, that is the great eternal light,
which for ever and ever is named the
Sun.
72.36 And this that rises is the great
light, which is named after its
appearance, as the Lord commanded.
72.37 And thus it rises and sets; it
neither decreases, nor rests, but runs day
and night in its chariot. And its light is
seven times brighter than that of the
Moon but in size the two are equal.
73.1 And after this law I saw another
law, for the lesser light, named the
Moon.
73.2 And its disc is like the disc of the
Sun, and the wind blows its chariot on
which it rides, and in fixed measure
light is given to it.
73.3 And every month it’s rising and
setting change, and its days are as the
days of the Sun, and when its light is
uniformly full, it is a seventh part the
light of the Sun.
73.4 And thus it rises, and its first phase
is towards the east; it rises on the
thirtieth morning. And on that day it
appears, and becomes for you the first
phase of the Moon, on the thirtieth
morning, together with the Sun in the
Gate through which the Sun rises.
73.5 And a half.(…..) .with a seventh
part, and its entire disc is empty,
without light, except for a seventh part,
a fourteenth part of it’s light.
73.6 And on the day that it receives a
seventh part and a half of its light, its
light amounts to a seventh, and a
seventh part and a half.
73.7 It sets with the Sun, and when the
Sun rises, the Moon rises with it, and
receives a half of one part of light. And
on that night at the beginning of its
morning, at the beginning of the Moon's
day, the Moon sets with the Sun, and is
dark on that night in six and seven parts
and a half.
73.8 And it rises on that day, with
exactly a seventh part, goes out, recedes
from the rising of the Sun, and becomes
bright on the remainder of its days, in
the other six and seven parts.
74.1 And another journey, and law, I
saw for it, in that according to this law it
makes its monthly journey.
74.2 And Uriel, the Holy Angel who is
leader of them all, showed me
everything, and I wrote down their
positions as he showed them to me.
And I wrote down their months, as they
are, and the appearance of their light,
until fifteen days have been completed.
74.3 In seventh parts it makes all its
darkness full, and in seventh parts it
32
makes all its light full, in the east and in
the west.
74.4 And in certain months, it changes
its setting, and in certain months, it
follows its own individual course.
74.5 In two months it sets with the Sun,
in those two Gates that are in the
middle, in the third and in the fourth
Gate.
74.6 It goes out for seven days and turns
back, and returns again to the Gate from
which the Sun rises. And in that Gate it
makes all its light full, and it recedes
from the Sun, and comes, in eight days,
to the sixth Gate from which the Sun
rises.
74.7 And when the Sun rises from the
fourth Gate, the Moon goes out for
seven days, until it rises from the fifth
Gate. And again it returns in seven days
to the fourth Gate, makes all its light
full, recedes, and comes to the first Gate
in eight days.
74.8 And again it returns in seven days
to the fourth Gate from which the Sun
rises.
74.9 Thus I saw their positions; how the
Moon rose and the Sun set in those
days.
74.10 And if five years are added
together, the Sun has an excess of thirty
days. For each year, of the five years,
there are three hundred and sixty four
days.
74.11 And the excess, of the Sun and
the stars, comes to six days. In five
years, with six days each, they have an
excess of thirty days, and the Moon falls
behind the Sun and the stars by thirty
days.
74.12 And the Moon conducts the years
exactly, all of them according to their
eternal positions; they are neither early
nor late, even by one day, but change
the year in exactly 364 days.
74.13 In three years, there are 1,092
days, and in five years 1,820 days, so
that in eight years there are 2,912 days.
74.14 For the Moon alone, the days in
three years come to 1,062 days, and in
five years it is fifty days behind.
74.15 And there are 1,770 days in five
years so that for the Moon the days in
eight years amount to 2,832 days.
74.16 For the difference in eight years is
eighty days, and all the days that the
Moon is behind, in eight years, are
eighty days.
74.17 And the year is completed
exactly, in accordance with their
positions, and the positions of the Sun,
in that they rise from the Gates from
which the Sun rises and sets for thirty
days.
75.1 And the leaders of the tens of
thousands, who are in charge of the
whole of creation, and in charge of all
the stars, and also the four days which
are added, and are not separated from
their position, according to the whole
reckoning of the year. And these serve
on the four days that are not counted in
the reckoning of the year.
75.2 And because of them men go
wrong in them. For these lights really
serve in the stations of the world, one in
the first Gate, and one in the third Gate,
and one in the fourth Gate, and one in
the sixth Gate. And the exact harmony
of the world is completed in the separate
364 stations of the world.
75.3 For the signs, and the times, and
the years, and the days, were showed to
me by the Angel Uriel whom the Lord
of Eternal Glory has placed in charge of
all the Lights of Heaven. In Heaven and
in the world, so that they might rule on
the Face of Heaven, and appear over the
earth, and be leaders of day and night;
the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and all the
serving creatures who revolve in all the
Chariots of Heaven.
75.4 Likewise, Uriel showed to me
twelve Gate-openings in the disc of the
chariot of the Sun, in the sky, from
which the rays of the Sun come out.
And from them heat comes out over the
Earth when they are opened at the times
that are appointed for them.
33
75.5 And there are openings for the
winds, and for the spirit of the dew,
when they are opened at their times,
opened in Heaven, at the ends of the
earth.
75.6 I saw twelve Gates in Heaven, at
the ends of the earth, from which the
Sun, and the Moon, and the stars, and
all the works of Heaven, go out in the
east and in the west.
75.7 And there are many windowopenings to the north and to the south,
and each window, at its appointed time,
sends out heat corresponding to those
Gates, from which the stars go out, in
accordance with His command to them,
and in which they set according to their
number.
75.8 And I saw chariots in Heaven,
running through the region above those
Gates, in which the stars that never set
rotate.
75.9 And one is bigger than all the
others. And it goes round through the
whole world.
76.1 And at the ends of the earth, I
saw twelve Gates open to all the winds,
from which the winds come out and
blow over the earth.
76.2 Three of them open in the front of
Heaven, and three in the back, and three
on the right of Heaven, and three on the
left.
76.3 And the three first are those
towards the east, and then the three
towards the north, and the three after
these towards the south, and the three in
the west.
76.4 Through four of them come winds
of blessing and peace. And from the
other eight come winds of punishment;
when they are sent they bring
devastation to the whole Earth, and to
the water which is on it, and to all those
who dwell upon it, and to everything
that is in the water and on dry ground.
76.5 And the first wind from those
Gates, called the east wind, comes out
through the first Gate, which is towards
the east. The one that comes from the
south brings devastation, drought, heat,
and destruction.
76.6 And through the second Gate, in
the middle, comes what is right. And
from it come rain, and fruitfulness, and
prosperity, and dew. And through the
third Gate, which is towards the north,
comes cold and drought.
76.7 And after these, the winds towards
the south come out, through three Gates.
First, through the first of the Gates,
which inclines towards the east, comes a
hot wind.
76.8 And through the middle Gate,
which is next to it, come pleasant
fragrances, and dew, and rain, and
prosperity, and life.
76.9 And through the third Gate, which
is towards the west, come dew, and rain,
and locusts, and devastation.
76.10 And after these, the winds
towards the north..(…)..from the
seventh Gate, which is towards the east,
come dew and rain, locusts and
devastation.
76.11 And through the Gate exactly in
the middle, come rain, and dew, and
life, and prosperity. And through the
third Gate, which is towards the west
come mist and hoarfrost, and snow, and
rain, and dew, and locusts.
76.12 And after these the winds towards
the west. Through the first Gate, which
inclines towards the north, come dew,
and rain, and hoarfrost, and cold, and
snow, and frost.
76.13 And from the middle Gate, come
dew and rain, prosperity and blessing.
And through the last Gate, which is
towards the south, come drought and
devastation, burning and destruction.
76.14 And thus the twelve Gates, of the
four quarters of Heaven are complete.
And all their laws, and all their
punishments, and all their benefits, I
have shown to you, my son Methuselah.
77.1 They called the first quarter
eastern because it is the first, and they
34
call the second the south because there
the Most High descends, and there
especially the one who is blessed
forever descends.
77.2 And the western quarter is called
waning because there all the lights of
Heaven wane and go down.
77.3 And the fourth quarter, named the
north, is divided into three parts. And
the first of them is the dwelling place
for men; and the second contains seas of
water, and the deeps, and the forests,
and rivers, and darkness and mist; and
the third part contains the Garden of
Righteousness.
77.4 I saw seven high mountains, which
were higher than all other mountains on
the earth; and from them snow comes.
And days and times and years, pass
away and go by.
77.5 I saw seven rivers on the earth,
larger than all the other rivers; one of
them comes from the east and pours out
its waters into the Great Sea.
77.6 And two of them come from the
north to the sea and pour out their water
into the Erythraean Sea in the east.
77.7 And the remaining four flow out
on the side of the north, to their seas,
two to the Erythraean Sea, and two into
the Great Sea, and they discharge
themselves there, and not into the
wilderness, as some say.
77.8 I saw seven large islands, in the sea
and on the land, two on the land, and
five in the Great Sea.
78.1 The names of the Sun are as
follows: The first Oryares, and the
second Tomases.
78.2 The Moon has four names: The
first name is Asonya, and the second
Ebla, and the third Benase, and the
fourth Era'e.
78.3 These are the two great lights; their
disc is like the disc of Heaven and in
size the two are equal.
78.4 In the disc of the Sun, are seven
parts of light, which are added to it
more than to the Moon, and in fixed
measure light is transferred to the Moon
until a seventh part of the Sun is
exhausted.
78.5 And they set, go into the Gates of
the west, go round through the north,
and rise through the Gates of the east,
on the face of Heaven.
78.6 And when the Moon rises, it
appears in the sky, and has a half of a
seventh part of light, and on the
fourteenth day it makes all its light full.
78.7 And fifteen parts of light are
transferred to it, until on the fifteenth
day its light is full, according to the sign
of the year, and amounts to fifteen parts.
And the Moon comes into being by
halves of a seventh part.
78.8 And in its waning on the first day,
it decreases to fourteen parts of its light.
And on the second to thirteen parts, and
on the third to twelve parts, on the
fourth to eleven parts, and on the fifth to
ten parts, and on the sixth to nine parts,
and on the seventh to eight parts, and on
the eighth to seven parts, and on the
ninth to six parts, and on the tenth to
five parts, and on the eleventh to four
parts, and on the twelfth to three, and on
the thirteenth to two, and on the
fourteenth to half of a seventh part.
And all the light that remains from the
total disappears on the fifteenth day.
78.9 And in certain months the Moon
has twenty-nine days and once twentyeight.
78.10 And Uriel showed me another
law: - when light is transferred to the
Moon, and on which side it is
transferred from the Sun.
78.11 All the time that the Moon is
increasing in its light, it transfers as it
becomes opposite the Sun, until in
fourteen days it’s light is full in the sky;
and when it is all ablaze, it’s light is full
in the sky.
78.12 And on the first day it is called
the New Moon, for on that, daylight
rises on it.
78.13 And its light becomes full exactly
on the day that as the Sun goes down in
35
the west it rises from the east for the
night. And the Moon shines for the
whole night until the Sun rises opposite
it, and the Moon is seen opposite the
Sun.
78.14 And on the side on which the
light of the Moon appears, there again it
wanes, until all its light disappears, and
the days of the Moon end and its disc
remains empty without light.
78.15 And for three months, at its
proper time, it achieves thirty days, and
for three months, it achieves twentynine days, during which it completes its
waning, in the first period, in the first
Gate, 127 days.
78.16 And in the time of it’s rising, for
three months, it appears in each month
with thirty days. And for three months
it appears in each month with twentynine days
78.17 By night, for twenty days each
time, it looks like a man, and by day
like Heaven, for there is nothing else in
it except it’s light.
79.1 And now, my son Methuselah, I
have shown you everything, and the
whole Law of the Stars of Heaven is
complete.
79.2 And he showed me the whole law
for these, for every day, and for every
time, and for every rule, and for every
year, and for the end thereof, according
to its command, for every month and
every week.
79.3 And the waning of the Moon,
which occurs in the sixth Gate, for in
that sixth Gate it’s light becomes full,
and after that it is the beginning of the
month.
79.4 And the waning, which occurs in
the first Gate, at its proper time, until
127 days are complete, or by weeks;
twenty-five weeks and two days.
79.5 And how it falls behind the Sun,
according to the law of the stars, by
exactly five days in one period of time,
when it has completed the pathway you
have seen.
79.6 Such is the appearance, and
likeness, of every light, which Uriel, the
great Angel who is their leader, showed
to me.
80.1 And in those days Uriel
answered me and said to me: “Behold, I
have shown you everything, Oh Enoch.
And I have revealed everything to you,
so that you may see this Sun, and this
Moon, and those who lead the Stars of
Heaven, and all those who turn them,
their tasks and their times and their
rising.
80.2 But in the days of the sinners the
years will become shorter, and their
seed will be late on their land, and on
their fields. And all things on the earth
will change and will not appear at their
proper time. And the rain will be
withheld and Heaven will retain it.
80.3 And in those times the fruits of the
earth will be late, and will not grow at
their proper time, and the fruits of the
trees will be withheld at their proper
time.
80.4 And the Moon will change its
customary practice and will not appear
at its proper time.
80.5 But in those days it will appear in
Heaven, come on top of a large chariot
in the west, and shine with more than
normal brightness.
80.6 And many heads of the stars, in
command, will go astray. And these
will change their courses and their
activities and will not appear at the
times that have been prescribed for
them.
80.7 And the entire law of the stars will
be closed to the sinners, and the
thoughts of those who dwell upon the
Earth will go astray over them, and they
will turn from all their ways and will go
astray, and will think them gods.
80.8 And many evils will overtake them
and punishment will come upon them to
destroy them all.”
36
81.1 And he said to me: “Oh Enoch,
look at the book of the Tablets of
Heaven and read what is written upon
them, and note every individual fact.”
81.2 And I looked at everything that
was written and I noted everything.
And I read the book and everything that
was written in it, all the deeds of men,
and all the children of flesh who will be
upon the Earth, for all the generations of
eternity.
81.3 And then I immediately blessed the
Lord, the Eternal King of Glory, in that
he has made all the works of the world,
and I praised the Lord because of his
patience, and I blessed him on account
of the sons of Adam.
81.4 And at that time I said: “Blessed is
the man who dies righteous and good,
concerning whom no book of iniquity
has been written, and against whom no
guilt has been found.”
81.5 And these three Holy ones brought
me and set me on the earth in front of
the door of my house, and said to me:
“Tell everything to your son
Methuselah, and show all your children
that no flesh is righteous, before the
Lord, for He created them.
81.6 For one year we will leave you
with your children, until you have
regained your strength, so that you may
teach your children and write these
things down for them, and testify to all
your children. And in the second year
we will take you from amongst them.
81.7 Let your heart be strong, for the
good will proclaim righteousness to the
good, the righteous will rejoice with the
righteous and they will wish each other
well.
81.8 But the sinner will die with the
sinner and the apostate will sink with
the apostate.
81.9 And those who practice
righteousness will die because of the
deeds of men, and will be gathered in
because of the deeds of the impious.”
81.10 And in those days they finished
speaking to me and I went to my family
as I blessed the Lord of Ages.
82.1 And now, my son Methuselah,
all these things I recount to you, and
write down for you. I have revealed
everything to you, and have given you
books about all these things. Keep, my
son Methuselah, the books from the
hand of your father so that you may
pass them on to the generations of
eternity.
82.2 I have given wisdom to you, and to
your children, and to those who will be
your children, that they may give it to
their children, for all the generations,
forever, this wisdom that is beyond their
thoughts.
82.3 And those who understand it will
not sleep, but will incline their ears that
they may learn this wisdom, and it will
be better for those who eat from it than
good food.
82.4 Blessed are all the righteous,
blessed are all those who walk in the
way of righteousness and do not sin like
the sinners.
In the numbering of all their days in
which the Sun journeys in Heaven,
coming in and out, through the Gates of
Heaven, for thirty days.
With the leaders of the thousands, of
this order of stars, and with the four
which are added, and divided between
the four seasons of the year, which lead
them and appear with them on four
days.
82.5 Because of them men go wrong,
and they do not reckon them in the
reckoning of the whole year; for men go
wrong in respect of them and do not
know them exactly.
82.6 For they belong in the reckoning of
the year, and are truly recorded forever,
one in the first Gate, and one in the
third, and one in the fourth and one in
the sixth. And the year is completed in
364 days.
37
82.7 And the account of it is true, and
the recorded reckoning of it is exact, for
the lights, and the months, and the
feasts, and the years, and the days.
Uriel showed me, and inspired me; he to
whom the Lord of the whole created
world gave commands about the Host of
Heaven for me.
82.8 And he has power in Heaven, over
night and day, to cause light to shine on
men; the Sun, the Moon, and the stars,
and all the Powers of Heaven, which
rotate in their orbits.
82.9 And this is the Law of the Stars,
which set in their places, at their times,
and at their feasts, and in their months.
82.10 And these are the names of those
who lead them, who keep watch, so that
they appear at their times, and in their
orders, and in their months, and in their
periods of rule, and in their positions.
82.11 Their four leaders, who divide the
four parts of the year, appear first; and
after them the twelve leaders of the
orders, who divide the months and the
years into 364 days, with the heads over
thousands, who separate the days. And
for the four days, that are added to
them, there are the leaders who separate
the four parts of the year.
82.12 And as for these heads over
thousands, one is added between the
leader and the led, but their leaders
make the separation.
82.13 And these are the names of the
leaders who separate the four appointed
parts of the year: Melkiel, Helemmelek,
Meleyal, and Narel.
82.14 And the names of those whom
they lead: Adnarel, Iyasusael, Iylumiel;
these three follow behind the leaders of
the orders. And all others follow behind
the three leaders of the orders, who
follow behind those leaders of positions,
who separate the four parts of the year.
82.15 In the beginning of the year,
Melkiel rises first and rules, who is
called the southern Sun - and all the
days of his period, during which he
rules, are ninety-one.
82.16 And these are the signs of the
days that are to be seen on the earth, in
the days of his period of rule; sweat, and
heat, and calm. And all the trees bear
fruit, and leaves appear on all the trees,
and the wheat harvest, and rose flowers.
And all the flowers bloom in the field
but the trees of winter are withered.
82.17 And these are the names of the
leaders who are under them: Berkeel,
Zelebsael, and another one who is
added, a head over a thousand, named
Heloyaseph. And the days of the period
of rule, of this one, are complete.
82.18 The second leader, after him, is
Helemmelec, whom they call the
Shining Sun; and all the days of his
light are ninety-one.
82.19 And these are the signs of the
days on earth: heat, and drought. And
the trees bring their fruit to ripeness and
maturity and make their fruit dry. And
the sheep mate and become pregnant.
And men gather all the fruits of the
earth, and everything that is in the
fields, and the vats of wine. And these
things occur in the days of his period of
rule.
82.20 And these are the names, and the
orders, and the leaders of these heads
over thousands: Gedaeyal, Keel, and
Heel. And the name of the head-over-athousand, who is added to them, is
Asfael. And the days of his period of
rule are complete.
Section IV. Chapters LXXXIIIXC.
The Dream-Visions.
83.1 And now, my son Methuselah, I
will show you all the visions that I saw,
recounting them before you.
83.2 Two visions I saw, before I took a
wife, and neither one was like the other.
For the first time, when I learnt the art
of writing, and for the second time,
38
before I took your mother. I saw a
terrible vision and concerning this I
made supplication to the Lord.
83.3 I had lain down in the house of my
grandfather, Malalel, when I saw in a
vision how Heaven was thrown down,
and removed, and it fell upon the Earth.
83.4 And when it fell upon the Earth, I
saw how the earth was swallowed up in
a great abyss, and mountains were
suspended on mountains, and hills sank
down upon hills, and tall trees were torn
up by their roots, and were thrown
down, and sank into the abyss.
83.5 And then speech fell into my
mouth, and I raised my voice to cry out,
and said: “The earth is destroyed!”
83.6 And my grandfather, Malalel,
roused me, since I lay near him, and
said to me: “Why did you cry out so,
my son, and why do you moan so?”
83.7 And I recounted to him the whole
vision, which I had seen, and he said to
me: “A terrible thing you have seen,
my son! Your dream vision concerns
the secrets of all the sin of the Earth; it
is about to sink into the abyss and be
utterly destroyed.
83.8 And now, my son, rise and make
supplication to the Lord of Glory, for
you are faithful, that a remnant may be
left on the Earth and that he may not
wipe out the whole Earth.
83.9 My son, from Heaven all this will
come upon the Earth, and upon the
Earth there will be great destruction.”
83.10 And then I rose and prayed, and
made supplication, and wrote my prayer
down for the generations of eternity,
and I will show everything to you my
son Methuselah.
83.11 And, when I went out below and
saw the sky, and the Sun rising in the
east, and the Moon setting in the west,
and some stars, and the whole Earth,
and everything as He knew it since the
beginning. Then I blessed the Lord of
Judgment and ascribed Majesty to him,
for he makes the Sun come out from the
windows of the east, so that it ascends
and rises on the face of Heaven, and
follows the path which has been shown
to it.
84.1 And I raised my hands in
righteousness and I blessed the Holy
and Great One. And I spoke with the
breath of my mouth, and with the
tongue of flesh, which God has made
for men born of flesh so that they might
speak with it; and he has given them
breath, and a tongue, and a mouth, so
that they might speak with them.
84.2 “Blessed are you, Oh Lord King,
and great and powerful in your majesty,
Lord of the whole Creation of Heaven,
King of Kings, and God of the whole
world! And your kingly authority, and
your Sovereignty and your Majesty will
last forever, and forever and ever, and
your power, for all generations. And all
the Heavens are your throne, forever,
and the whole Earth your footstool
forever, and ever and ever.
84.3 For you made, and you rule,
everything, and nothing is too hard for
you, and no wisdom escapes you; it
does not turn away from your throne
nor from your presence. And you
know, and see, and hear, everything,
and nothing is hidden from you, for you
see everything.
84.4 And now the Angels of your
Heaven are doing wrong and your anger
rests upon the flesh of men until the day
of the great judgment.
84.5 And now, Oh God, Lord, and
Great King, I entreat and ask that you
will fulfill my prayer to leave me a
posterity on Earth and not to wipe out
all the flesh of men and make the earth
empty so that there is destruction
forever.
84.6 And now, my Lord, wipe out from
the earth the flesh that has provoked
your anger, but the flesh of
righteousness and uprightness establish
as a seed bearing plant forever. And do
not hide your face from the prayer of
your servant, Oh Lord.”
39
85.1 And after this I saw another
dream, and I will show it all to you, my
son.
85.2 And Enoch raised his voice and
said to his son Methuselah: “To you I
speak, my son. Hear my words, and
incline your ear to the dream vision of
your father.
85.3 Before I took your mother, Edna, I
saw a vision on my bed: - and behold - a
bull came out of the earth, and that bull
was white.
And, after it, a heifer came out, and with
the heifer came two bullocks, and one
of them was black and the other red.
85.4 And that black bullock struck the
red one, and pursued it over the earth,
and from then on I could not see that red
bullock.
85.5 But that black bullock grew, and a
heifer went with it; and I saw that many
bulls came out from it, which were like
it, and followed behind it.
85.6 And that cow, that first one, came
from the presence of that first bull,
seeking that red bullock, but did not
find it. And then it moaned bitterly and
continued to seek it.
85.7 And I looked until that first bull
came to it, and calmed it, and from that
time it did not cry out.
85.8 And after this, she bore another
white bull, and after this she bore many
black bulls and cows.
85.9 And I saw, in my sleep, that white
bull, how it likewise grew and became a
large white bull. And from it came
many white bulls, and they were like it.
85.10 And they began to beget many
white bulls that were like them - one
following another.
86.1 And again, I looked with my
eyes as I was sleeping, and I saw
Heaven above, and behold, a star fell
from Heaven, and it arose and ate and
pastured amongst those bulls.
86.2 And, after this, I saw the large and
the black bulls, and behold, all of them
changed their pens, and their pastures,
and their heifers. And they began to
moan, one after another.
86.3 And, again, I saw in the vision and
looked up at Heaven, and behold, I saw
many stars, how they came down, and
were thrown down from Heaven to that
first star, and fell amongst those heifers
and bulls. They were with them
pasturing amongst them.
86.4 And I looked at them and saw, and
behold, all of them let out their private
parts, like horses, and began to mount
the cows of the bulls. And they all
became pregnant and bore elephants,
camels, and asses.
86.5 And all the bulls were afraid of
them, and were terrified in front of
them. And they began to bite with their
teeth, and to devour, and to gore with
their horns.
86.6 And so they began to devour those
bulls, and behold, all the sons of the
Earth began to tremble and shake before
them and to flee.
87.1 And again I saw them, how
they began to gore one another, and to
devour one another, and the Earth began
to cry out.
87.2 And I raised my eyes again to
Heaven, and saw in the vision, and
behold, there came from Heaven beings
that were like white men. And four
came from that place, and three others
with them.
87.3 And those three, who came out
last, took hold of me by my hand and
raised me from the generations of the
Earth, and lifted me up onto a high
place, and showed me a tower high
above the earth, and all the hills were
lower.
87.4 And one said to me: “Remain here
until you have seen everything which is
coming upon these elephants, and
camels, and asses, and upon the stars,
and upon all the bulls.”
40
88.1 And I saw one of those four
who had come out first, how he took
hold of that first star, which had fallen
from Heaven, and bound it by its hands
and feet, and threw it into an abyss.
And that abyss was narrow, and deep,
and horrible, and dark.
88.2 And one of them drew his sword,
and gave it to those elephants, camels,
and asses; and they began to strike one
another, and the whole Earth shook
because of them.
88.3 And as I looked in the vision,
behold, one of those four who had come
out cast a line from Heaven and
gathered and took all the large stars;
those whose private parts were like the
private parts of horses, and bound them
all by their hands and their feet, and
threw them into a chasm of the Earth.
89.1 And one of those four, went to
a white bull, and taught him a mystery,
trembling as he was. He was born a
bull, but became a man, and built for
himself a large vessel, and dwelt on it,
and three bulls went with him in that
vessel, and they were covered over.
89.2 And, again, I raised my eyes to
Heaven and saw a high roof with seven
water channels on it, and those channels
discharged much water into an
enclosure.
89.3 And I looked again, and behold,
springs opened on the floor of that large
enclosure, and water began to bubble
up, and to rise above the floor. And I
looked at that enclosure until its whole
floor was covered by water.
89.4 And water, darkness, and mist
increased on it, and I looked at the
height of that water, and that water had
risen above that enclosure and was
pouring out over the enclosure, and it
remained on the earth.
89.5 And all the bulls of that enclosure
were gathered together, until I saw how
they sank, and were swallowed up, and
destroyed, in that water.
89.6 And that vessel floated on the
water, but all the bulls, elephants,
camels, and asses sank to the bottom,
together with all the animals, so that I
could not see them. And they were
unable to get out, but were destroyed,
and sank into the depths.
89.7 And, again, I looked at that vision
until those water channels were
removed from that high roof, and the
chasms of the Earth were made level,
and other abysses were opened.
89.8 And the water began to run down
into them, until the earth became
visible, and that vessel settled on the
earth and the darkness departed, and
light appeared.
89.9 And that white bull, who became a
man, went out from that vessel, and the
three bulls with him. And one of the
three bulls was white, like that bull, and
one of them was red as blood, and one
was black. And that white bull passed
away from them.
89.10 And they began to beget wild
animals and birds, so that there arose
from them every kind of species: lions,
tigers, wolves, dogs, hyenas, wildboars, foxes, badgers, pigs, falcons,
vultures, kites, eagles, and ravens. But
amongst them was born a white bull.
89.11 And they began to bite one
another but that white bull, which was
born amongst them, begat a wild ass
and a white bull with it, and the wild
asses increased.
89.12 But that bull, which was born
from it, begat a black wild boar and a
white sheep, and that wild-boar begat
many boars and that sheep begat twelve
sheep.
89.13 And when those twelve sheep had
grown, they handed one of their number
over to the asses, and those in turn,
handed that sheep over to the wolves;
and that sheep grew up amongst the
wolves.
89.14 And the Lord brought the eleven
sheep to dwell with it, and to pasture
41
with it amongst the wolves, and they
increased and became many flocks of
sheep.
89.15 And the wolves began to make
them afraid, and they oppressed them
until they made away with their young,
and then they threw their young into a
river with much water; but those sheep
began to cry out because of their young,
and to complain to their Lord.
89.16 But a sheep, which had been
saved from the wolves, fled and escaped
to the wild asses. And I saw the sheep
moaning and crying out, and petitioning
the Lord with all their power, until that
Lord of the sheep came down at the call
of the sheep, from a high room, and
came to them, and looked at them.
89.17 And he called that sheep, which
had fled from the wolves, and spoke to
it about the wolves, that it should warn
them that they should not touch the
sheep.
89.18 And the sheep went to the
wolves, in accordance with the Word of
the Lord, and another sheep met that
sheep and went with it. And the two of
them together, entered the assembly of
those wolves, spoke to them, and
warned them that from then on, they
should not touch those sheep.
89.19 And after this, I saw the wolves,
how they acted even more harshly
towards the sheep, with all their power,
and the sheep called out.
89.20 And their Lord came to the sheep
and began to beat those wolves; and the
wolves began to moan, but the sheep
became silent and from then on they did
not cry out.
89.21 And I looked at the sheep until
they escaped from the wolves; but the
eyes of the wolves were blinded, and
those wolves went out in pursuit of the
sheep with all their forces.
89.22 And the Lord of the sheep went
with them, as he led them, and all his
sheep followed him; and his face was
glorious, and his appearance terrible and
magnificent.
89.23 But the wolves began to pursue
those sheep until they met them by a
stretch of water.
89.24 And that stretch of water was
divided, and the water stood on one
side, and on the other, before them.
And their Lord as he led them, stood
between them and the wolves.
89.25 And while those wolves had not
yet seen the sheep, they went into the
middle of that stretch of water; but the
wolves pursued the sheep, and those
wolves ran after them into that stretch of
water.
89.26 But when they saw the Lord of
the sheep they turned to flee in front of
him; but that stretch of water flowed
together again, and suddenly resumed
its natural form, and the water swelled
up, and rose until it covered those
wolves.
89.27 And I looked until all the wolves
that had pursued those sheep were
destroyed and drowned.
89.28 But the sheep escaped that water,
and went to a desert, where there was
neither water, nor grass. And they
began to open their eyes and see, and I
saw the Lord of the sheep pasturing
them, and giving them water and grass,
and that sheep going and leading them.
89.29 And that sheep went up to the
summit of a high rock and the Lord of
the sheep sent it to them.
89.30 And after this, I saw the Lord of
the sheep standing before them, and his
appearance was terrible and majestic,
and all those sheep saw him and were
afraid of him.
89.31 And all of them were afraid and
trembled before him; and they cried out
to that sheep, with those who were in
their midst: “We cannot stand before
our Lord nor look at him.”
89.32 And that sheep, which led them,
again went up to the summit of that
rock; and the sheep began to be blinded,
and go astray from the path which had
been shown to them, but that sheep did
not know.
42
89.33 And the Lord of the sheep was
extremely angry with them, and that
sheep knew, and went down from the
summit of the rock, and came to the
sheep, and found the majority of them,
with their eyes blinded, and going
astray from his path.
89.34 And when they saw it they were
afraid and trembled before it and wished
that they could return to their enclosure.
And that sheep took some other sheep
with it, and went to those sheep that had
gone astray, and then began to kill
them; and the sheep were afraid of it.
And that sheep brought back those
sheep that had gone astray, and they
returned to their enclosures.
89.36 And I looked there at the vision,
until that sheep became a man, and built
a house for the Lord of the sheep, and
made all the sheep stand in that house.
89.37 And I looked until that sheep,
which had met that sheep that led the
sheep, fell asleep. And I looked until all
the large sheep were destroyed and
small ones arose in their place, and they
came to a pasture, and drew near a river
of water.
89.38 And that sheep that led them,
which had become a man, separated
from them and fell asleep, and all the
sheep sought it, and cried out very
bitterly over it.
89.39 And I looked until they left off
crying for that sheep, and crossed that
river of water. And there arose all the
sheep that led them, in place of those
which had fallen asleep; and they led.
89.40 And I looked until the sheep came
to a good place and a pleasant and
glorious land, and I looked until those
sheep were satisfied. And that house
was in the middle of them in that green
and pleasant land.
89.41 And sometimes their eyes were
opened, and sometimes blinded, until
another sheep rose up, led them, and
brought them all back. And their eyes
were opened.
89.42 And the dogs, and the foxes, and
the wild boars, began to devour those
sheep until the Lord of the sheep raised
up a ram from among them, which led
them.
89.43 And that ram began to butt those
dogs, foxes, and wild boars, on one side
and on the other until it had destroyed
them all.
89.44 And the eyes of that sheep were
opened, and it saw that ram in the
middle of the sheep, how it renounced
its glory, and began to butt those sheep,
and how it trampled on them and
behaved unbecomingly.
89.45 And the Lord of the sheep sent
the sheep to another sheep and raised it
up to be a ram and to lead the sheep in
place of that sheep which had
renounced its glory.
89.46 And it went to it, and spoke with
it alone, and raised up that ram, and
made it the prince and leader of the
sheep. And, during all this, those dogs
oppressed the sheep.
89.47 And the first ram pursued that
second ram and that second ram rose
and fled before it. And I looked until
those dogs made the first ram fall.
89.48 And that second ram rose up and
led the small sheep, and that ram begat
many sheep, and fell asleep. And a
small sheep became a ram, in place of
it, and became the prince and leader of
those sheep.
89.49 And those sheep grew and
increased; but all the dogs, and foxes,
and wild boars, were afraid and fled
from it. And that ram butted and killed
all the animals, and those animals did
not again prevail amongst the sheep,
and did not seize anything further from
them.
89.50 And that house became large and
broad, and for those sheep a high tower
was built on that house for the Lord of
the sheep. And that house was low but
the tower was raised up and high. And
the Lord of the sheep stood on that
tower and they spread a full table before
him.
43
89.51 And I saw those sheep again, how
they went astray, and walked in many
ways, and left that house of theirs; and
the Lord of the sheep called some of the
sheep, and sent them to the sheep, but
the sheep began to kill them.
89.52 But one of them was saved, and
was not killed, and it sprang away and
cried out against the sheep. And they
wished to kill it but the Lord of the
sheep saved it from the hands of the
sheep, brought it up to me, and made it
stay.
89.53 And he sent many other sheep to
those sheep, to testify to them and to
lament over them.
89.54 And after this, I saw how when
they left the house of the Lord of the
sheep, and his tower, they went astray in
everything, and their eyes were blinded.
And I saw how the Lord of the sheep
wrought much slaughter among them, in
their pastures, until those sheep invited
that slaughter, and betrayed his place.
89.55 And he gave them into the hands
of the lions, and the tigers, and the
wolves, and the hyenas, and into the
hands of the foxes, and to all the
animals. And those wild animals began
to tear those sheep in pieces.
89.56 And I saw how he left that house
of theirs, and their tower, and gave them
all into the hands of the lions so that
they might tear them in pieces and
devour them, and into the hands of all
the animals.
89.57 And I began to cry out with all
my power, to call the Lord of the sheep,
and to represent to him concerning the
sheep; that all the wild animals were
devouring them.
89.58 But he remained still, although he
saw, and he rejoiced that they were
devoured, swallowed up and carried off.
And he gave them into the hands of all
the animals for food.
89.59 And he called seventy shepherds,
and cast off those sheep, so that they
might pasture them. And he said to the
shepherds and to their companions:
“Each one of you, from now on, is to
pasture the sheep and do whatever I
command you.
89.60 And I will hand them over to you,
duly numbered, and I will tell you
which of them are to be destroyed, and
destroy them.” And he handed those
sheep over to them.
89.61 And he called another, and said to
him: “Observe and see everything that
these shepherds do against these sheep
for they will destroy from among them
more than I have commanded them.
89.62 And write down all the excess
and destruction, which is wrought by
the shepherds; how many they destroy
at my command and how many they
destroy of their own volition. Write
down against each shepherd,
individually, all that he destroys.
89.63 And read out in front of me
exactly how many they destroy of their
own volition and how many are handed
over for destruction so that this may be
a testimony for me against them. So
that I may know all the deeds of the
shepherds in order to hand them over
for judgment. And I will see what they
do, whether they abide by my command
with which I have commanded them, or
not.
89.64 But they must not know this, and
you must not show this to them, but
only write down against each individual
in his time all that the shepherds
destroy, and bring it all up to me.”
89.65 And I looked until those
shepherds pastured at their times, and
they began to kill and destroy more than
they were commanded, and they gave
those sheep into the hands of the lions.
89.66 And the lions and the tigers
devoured and swallowed up the
majority of those sheep, and the wild
boars devoured with them; and they
burnt down that tower and demolished
that house.
89.67 And I was extremely sad about
that tower because that house of the
sheep had been demolished; and after
44
that I was unable to see whether those
sheep went into that house.
89.68 And the shepherds and their
companions handed those sheep over to
all the animals so that they might
devour them. Each one of them, at his
time, received an exact number, and for
each of them, one after the other, there
was written in a book how many of
them were destroyed.
89.69 And each one killed and
destroyed more than was prescribed and
I began to weep and moan very much
because of those sheep.
89.70 And likewise, in the vision, I saw
that one who wrote, how each day, he
wrote down each one that was destroyed
by those shepherds. And he brought up,
and presented, the whole book to the
Lord of the sheep, everything they had
done and all that each one of them had
made away with, and all that they had
handed to destruction.
89.71 And the book was read out in
front of the Lord of the sheep, and he
took the book in his hand, read it, sealed
it, and put it down.
89.72 And after this I saw how the
shepherds pastured for twelve hours,
and behold three of those sheep
returned, and arrived, and came and
began to build up all that had fallen
down from that house; but the wild
boars hindered them so that they could
not.
89.73 And they again began to build, as
before, and they raised up that tower,
and it was called the high tower. And
they began again to place a table before
the tower but all the bread on it was
unclean and was not pure.
89.74 And, besides all this, the eyes of
these sheep were blinded so that they
could not see, and their shepherds
likewise. And they handed yet more of
them over to destruction, and they
trampled on the sheep with their feet,
and devoured them.
89.75 But the Lord of the sheep
remained still, until all the sheep were
scattered abroad, and had mixed with
them, and they did not save them from
the hands of the animals.
89.76 And that one who wrote the book
brought it up, showed it, and read it out
in the dwelling of the Lord of the sheep.
And he entreated Him on behalf of
them, and petitioned Him, as he showed
Him all the deeds of their shepherds and
testified in front of Him against all the
shepherds.
89.77 And he took the book, put it down
by Him, and went out.
90.1 And I looked until the time that
thirty-five shepherds had pastured the
sheep the same way, and, each
individually; they all completed their
time like the first ones. And others
received them into their hands to
pasture them, at their time, each
shepherd at his own time.
90.2 And after this, I saw in the vision,
all the birds of the sky coming: - The
eagles, the vultures, and the kites, and
the ravens. But the eagles led all the
birds, and they began to devour those
sheep, to peck out their eyes, and to
devour their flesh.
90.3 And the sheep cried out because
the birds devoured their flesh. And I
cried out and lamented in my sleep
because of that shepherd who pastured
the sheep.
90.4 And I looked until those sheep
were devoured by those dogs, and by
the eagles, and by the kites, and they
left them neither flesh nor skin, nor
sinew, until only their bones remained.
And their bones fell upon the ground
and the sheep became few.
90.5 And I looked until the time that
twenty-three shepherds had pastured,
and they completed, each in his time,
fifty eight times.
90.6 And small lambs were born from
those white sheep, and they began to
open their eyes, to see, and to cry to the
sheep.
90.7 But the sheep did not cry to them,
45
and did not listen to what they said to
them, but were extremely deaf, and their
eyes were extremely and excessively
blinded.
90.8 And I saw in the vision, how the
ravens flew upon those lambs, and took
one of those lambs, and dashed the
sheep in pieces and devoured them.
90.9 And I looked until horns came up
on those lambs but the ravens cast their
horns down. And I looked until a big
horn grew on one of those sheep, and
their eyes were opened.
90.10 And it looked at them and their
eyes were opened. And it cried to the
sheep, and the rams saw it, and they all
ran to it.
90.11 And, besides all this, those eagles,
and vultures, and ravens, and kites, were
still continually tearing the sheep in
pieces, and flying upon them and
devouring them. And the sheep were
silent but the rams lamented and cried
out.
90.12 And those ravens battled and
fought with it, and wished to make
away with its horn, but they did not
prevail against it.
90.13 And I looked at them until the
shepherds and the eagles, and those
vultures, and kites, came and cried to
the ravens that they should dash the
horn of that ram in pieces. And they
fought and battled with it, and it fought
with them and cried out so that its help
might come to it.
90.14 And I looked until that man, who
wrote down the names of the shepherds
and brought them up before the Lord of
the sheep, came, and he helped that ram
and showed it everything; its help was
coming down.
90.15 And I looked until that Lord of
the sheep came to them in anger, all
those who saw him fled, and they all
fell into the shadow in front of Him.
90.16 All the eagles and vultures and
ravens and kites, gathered together and
brought with them all the wild sheep,
and they all came together and helped
one another in order to dash that horn of
the ram in pieces.
90.17 And I looked at that man, who
wrote the book at the command of the
Lord, until he opened that book of the
destruction that those last twelve
shepherds had wrought. And he
showed, in front of the Lord of the
sheep, that they had destroyed even
more than those before them had.
90.18 And I looked until the Lord of the
sheep came to them and took the Staff
of His Anger and struck the Earth. And
the Earth was split. And all the animals,
and the birds of the sky, fell from those
sheep and sank in the earth; and it
closed over them.
90.19 And I looked until a big sword
was given to the sheep. And the sheep
went out against all the wild animals to
kill them. And all the animals, and
birds of the sky, fled before them.
90.20 And I looked until a throne was
set up in a pleasant land and the Lord of
the sheep sat on it. And they took all
the sealed books and opened the books
in front of the Lord of the sheep.
90.21 And the Lord called those men,
the seven first white ones, and
commanded them to bring in front of
Him the first star, which went before
those stars whose private parts were like
horses, and they brought them all in
front of Him.
90.22 And He said to that man who
wrote in front of Him, who was one of
the seven white ones, He said to him:
“Take those seventy shepherds, to
whom I handed over the sheep, and
who, on their own authority, took and
killed more than I commanded them.”
90.23 And behold, I saw them all
bound, and they all stood in front of
Him.
90.24 And the judgment was held, first
on the stars, and they were judged and
found guilty, and they went to the place
of damnation, and were thrown into a
deep place full of fire burning, and full
of pillars of fire.
46
90.25 And those seventy shepherds
were judged, and found guilty, and they
also were thrown into that abyss of fire.
90.26 And I saw at that time, how a
similar abyss was opened in the middle
of the Earth which was full of fire, and
they brought those blind sheep and they
were all judged, and found guilty, and
thrown into that abyss of fire and they
burned. And that abyss was on the
south of that house.
90.27 And I saw those sheep burning
and their bones were burning.
90.28 And I stood up to look until he
folded up that old house, and they
removed all the pillars, and all the
beams and ornaments of that house
were folded up with it. And they
removed it and put it in a place in the
south of the land.
90.29 And I looked until the Lord of the
sheep brought a new house, larger and
higher than the first one, and he set it up
on the site of the first one that had been
folded up. And all its pillars were new,
and its ornaments were new and larger
than those of the first one - the old one
that had been removed. And the Lord
of the sheep was in the middle of it.
90.30 And I saw all the sheep that were
left, and all the animals of the earth, and
all the birds of the sky, falling down and
worshipping those sheep, and entreating
them and obeying them in every
command.
90.31 And after this, those three who
were dressed in white and had taken
hold of my hand, the ones who had
brought me up at first. They, with the
hand of that ram also holding me, took
me up, and put me down in the middle
of those sheep before the judgment was
held.
90.32 And those sheep were all white
and their wool thick and pure.
90.33 And all those which had been
destroyed and scattered, and all the wild
animals, and all the birds of the sky,
gathered together in that house, and the
Lord of the sheep rejoiced very much
because they were all good, and had
returned to His house.
90.34 And I looked until they had laid
down that sword, which had been given
to the sheep, and they brought it back
into his house, and it was sealed in front
of the Lord. And all the sheep were
enclosed in that house but it did not
hold them.
90.35 And the eyes of all of them were
opened, and they saw well, and there
was not one among them that did not
see.
90.36 And I saw that that house was
large, broad, and exceptionally full.
90.37 And I saw how a white bull was
born, and its horns were big, and all the
wild animals, and all the birds of the
sky, were afraid of it, and entreated it
continually.
90.38 And I looked until all their
species were transformed and they all
became white bulls. And the first
among them was a wild-ox. And that
wild-ox was a large animal and had big
black horns on its head. And the Lord
of the sheep rejoiced over them, and
over all the bulls.
90.39 And I was asleep in the middle of
them and I woke up and saw everything.
90.40 And this is the vision which I saw
while I was asleep, and I woke up,
blessed the Lord of Righteousness, and
ascribed glory to him.
90.41 But after this I wept bitterly and
my tears did not stop until I could not
endure it. When I looked, they ran
down, because of what I saw, for
everything will come to pass and be
fulfilled, and all the deeds of men, in
their order, were shown to me.
90.42 That night I remembered my first
dream, and because of it I wept, and
was disturbed, because I had seen that
vision.
Section V. XCI-CIV
A Book of Exhortation and
Promised Blessing for the
47
Righteous and of Malediction
and Woe for the Sinners.
91.1 And now my son Methuselah,
call to me all your brothers, and gather
to me all the children of your mother.
For a voice calls me, and a spirit has
been poured over me, so that I may
show you everything that will come
upon you forever.
91.2 And after this Methuselah went
and called his brothers to him and
gathered his relations.
91.3 And he spoke about righteousness
to all his sons, and said:
“Hear, my children, all the words of
your father, and listen properly to the
voice of my mouth, for I will testify and
speak to you - my beloved. Love
uprightness and walk in it!
91.4 And do not draw near to
uprightness with a double heart, and do
not associate with those of a double
heart, but walk in righteousness my
children and it will lead you in good
paths, and righteousness will be your
companion.
91.5 For I know that the state of
wrongdoing will continue on Earth, and
a great punishment will be carried out
on the Earth, and an end will be made of
all iniquity. And it will be cut off at its
roots and its whole edifice will pass
away.
91.6 And iniquity will again be
complete on the Earth, and all the deeds
of iniquity, and the deeds of wrong, and
of wickedness, will prevail for a second
time.”
91.7 And when iniquity, and sin, and
blasphemy, and wrong, and all kinds of
evil deeds increase, and when apostasy,
wickedness, and uncleanness increase, a
great punishment will come from
Heaven upon all these. And the Holy
Lord will come in anger, and in wrath,
to execute judgment on the Earth.
91.8 In those days wrongdoing will be
cut off at its roots, and the roots of
iniquity, together with deceit, will be
destroyed from under Heaven.
91.9 And all the idols of the nations will
be given up, their towers will be burnt
in fire, and they will remove them from
the whole Earth. And they will be
thrown down into the Judgment of Fire,
and will be destroyed in anger, and in
the severe judgment that is forever.
91.10 And the righteous will rise from
sleep, and wisdom will rise, and will be
given to them.
91.11 And after this the roots of iniquity
will be cut off and the sword will
destroy the sinners. The blasphemers
will be cut off; in every place
blasphemy will be destroyed by the
sword.
91.12 And after this there will be
another week; the eighth, that of
righteousness, and a sword will be
given to it so that the Righteous
Judgment may be executed on those
who do wrong, and the sinners will be
handed over into the hands of the
righteous.
91.13 And, at its end, they will acquire
Houses because of their righteousness,
and a House will be built for the Great
King in Glory, forever.
91.14 And after this, in the ninth week,
the Righteous Judgment will be
revealed to the whole world. And all
the deeds of the impious will vanish
from the whole Earth. And the world
will be written down for destruction and
all men will look to the Path of
Uprightness.
91.15 And, after this, in the tenth week,
in the seventh part, there will be an
Eternal Judgment that will be executed
on the Watchers and the Great Eternal
Heaven that will spring from the midst
of the Angels.
91.16 And the First Heaven will vanish
and pass away and a New Heaven will
appear, and all the Powers of Heaven
will shine forever, with sevenfold light.
48
91.17 And after this, there will be many
weeks without number, forever, in
goodness and in righteousness. And
from then on sin will never again be
mentioned.
91.18 And now I tell you, my children,
and show you the paths of
righteousness, and the paths of
wrongdoing. And I will show you again
so that you may know what is to come.
91.19 And now listen, my children,
walk in the paths of righteousness and
do not walk in the paths of wrongdoing,
for all those who walk in the path of
iniquity will be destroyed forever.
92.1 Written by Enoch-the-Scribe,
this complete wisdom and teaching,
praised by all men and a judge of the
whole Earth.
For all my sons who dwell on Earth.
And for the last generations who will
practice justice and peace.
92.2 Let not your spirit be saddened by
the times for the Holy and Great One
has appointed days for all things.
92.3 And the righteous man will rise
from sleep, will rise and will walk in the
path of righteousness, and all his paths,
and his journeys, will be in eternal
goodness and mercy.
92.4 He will show mercy to the
righteous man and to him give eternal
uprightness, and to him give power.
And he will live in goodness, and
righteousness, and will walk in eternal
light.
92.5 And sin will be destroyed in
darkness, forever, and from that day
will never again be seen.
93.1 And, after this, Enoch began to
speak from the books:
93.2 And Enoch said: “Concerning the
sons of righteousness, and concerning
the chosen of the world, and concerning
the plant of righteousness and
uprightness, I will speak these things to
you, and make them known to you, my
children.
I, Enoch, according to that which
appeared to me in the Heavenly vision,
and that which I know from the words
of the Holy Angels, and understanding
from the Tablets of Heaven.”
93.3 And Enoch then began to speak
from the books, and said: “I was born
the seventh, in the first week, while
justice and righteousness still lasted.
93.4 And, after me, in the second week,
great injustice will arise, and deceit will
have sprung up. And in it there will be
the First End, and in it, a man will be
saved. And after it has ended, iniquity
will grow, and He will make a law for
the sinners.
93.5 And after this in the third week, at
its end, a man will be chosen as the
Plant of Righteous Judgment, and after
him will come the Plant of
Righteousness, forever.
93.6 And after this, in the fourth week,
at its end, visions of the righteous and
Holy will be seen, and a Law for All
Generations, and an enclosure will be
made for them.
93.7 And after this, in the fifth week, at
its end, a House of Glory and
Sovereignty will be built forever.
93.8 And after this, in the sixth week,
all those who live in it will be blinded.
And the hearts of them all, lacking
wisdom, will sink into impiety. And in
it, a man will ascend, and at its end the
House of Sovereignty will be burnt with
fire. And in it the whole race of the
chosen root will be scattered.
93.9 And after this, in the seventh
week, an apostate generation will arise.
And many will be its deeds - but all its
deeds will be apostasy.
93.10 And at its end, the Chosen
Righteous, from the Eternal Plant of
Righteousness, will be chosen, to whom
will be given sevenfold teaching,
concerning his whole creation.
93.11 For is there any man who can
49
hear the voice of the Holy One and not
be disturbed? And who is there who
can think his thoughts? And who is
there who can look at all the works of
Heaven?
93.12 And how should there be anyone
who could understand the works of
Heaven, and see a soul, or a spirit, and
tell about it, or ascend and see all their
ends and comprehend them, or make
anything like them?
93.13 And is there any man who could
know the length and breadth of the
Earth? And to who has all its
measurements been shown?
93.14 Or is there any man who could
know the length of Heaven, and what is
its height, and on what is it fixed, and
how large is the number of stars, and
where do all the lights rest?
94.1 And now I say to you, my
children, love righteousness and walk in
it; for the paths of righteousness are
worthy of acceptance, but the paths of
iniquity will quickly be destroyed and
vanish.
94.2 And to certain men, from a future
generation, the paths of wrongdoing and
of death will be revealed; and they will
keep away from them and will not
follow them.
94.3 And now I say to you, the
righteous: do not walk in the wicked
path, or in wrongdoing, or in the paths
of death, and do not draw near to them
or you may be destroyed.
94.4 But seek, and choose for yourself,
righteousness, and a life that is pleasing
and walk in the paths of peace so that
you may live and prosper.
94.5 And hold my words firmly in the
thoughts of your heart, and do not let
them be erased from your heart, for I
know that sinners will tempt men to
debase wisdom, and no place will be
found for it, and temptation will in no
way decrease.
94.6 Woe to those who build iniquity
and found deceit for they will quickly
be thrown down and will not have
peace.
94.7 Woe to those who build their
houses with sin, for from their whole
foundation they will be thrown down,
and by the sword they shall fall, and
those who acquire gold and silver will
quickly be destroyed in the judgment.
94.8 Woe to you, you rich, for you have
trusted in your riches, but from your
riches you will depart for you did not
remember the Most High in the days of
your riches.
94.9 You have committed blasphemy,
and iniquity, and are ready for the days
of the outpouring of blood, and for the
day of darkness, and for the day of the
Great Judgment.
94.10 Thus I say, and make known to
you, that He who created you will throw
you down, and over your fall there will
be no mercy, but your creator will
rejoice at your destruction.
94.11 And your righteousness in those
days will be a reproach to the sinners
and to the impious.
95.1 Would that my eyes were a
rain-cloud, so that I might weep over
you, and pour out my tears like rain, so
that I might have rest from the sorrow
of my heart!
95.2 Who permitted you to practice
hatred and wickedness? May judgment
come upon you, the sinners!
95.3 Do not be afraid of the sinners, you
righteous, for the Lord will again
deliver them into your hands, so that
you may execute judgment on them as
you desire.
95.4 Woe to you who pronounce
anathema that you cannot remove..
Healing will be far from you because of
your sin.
95.5 Woe to you who repay your
neighbours with evil for you will be
repaid according to your deeds.
95.6 Woe to you, you lying witnesses,
and to those who weigh out iniquity, for
50
you will quickly be destroyed.
95.7 Woe to you, you sinners, because
you persecute the righteous, for you
yourselves will be handed over and
persecuted, you men of iniquity, and
their yoke will be heavy on you.
96.1 Be hopeful, you righteous, for
the sinners will quickly be destroyed
before you, and you will have power
over them, as you desire.
96.2 And in the day of the distress of
the sinners, your young will rise up, like
eagles, and your nest will be higher than
that of vultures. And you will go up,
and like badgers, enter the crevices of
the earth, and the clefts of the rock,
forever, before the lawless, but they will
groan and weep because of you, like
satyrs.
96.3 And do not be afraid you who have
suffered, for you will receive healing,
and a bright light will shine upon you,
and the Voice of Rest you will hear
from Heaven.
96.4 Woes to you, you sinners, for your
riches make you appear righteous, but
your hearts prove you to be sinners.
And this word will be a testimony
against you as a reminder of your evil
deeds.
96.5 Woe to you who devour the finest
of the wheat, and drink the best of the
water, and trample upon the humble
through your power.
96.6 Woe to you who drink water all the
time, for you will quickly be repaid, and
will become exhausted and dry for you
have left the spring of life.
96.7 Woe to you who commit iniquity,
and deceit, and blasphemy, it will be a
reminder of evil against you.
96.8 Woe to you, you powerful, who
through power oppress the righteous;
for the day of your destruction will
come.
In those days many good days will
come for the righteous in the day of
your judgment.
97.1 Believe, you righteous, that the
sinners will become an object of shame
and will be destroyed on the Day of
Judgment.
97.2 Be it known to you, sinners, that
the Most High remembers your
destruction and that the Angels rejoice
over your destruction.
97.3 What will you do, you sinners, and
where will you flee on that day of
judgment when you hear the sound of
prayer of the righteous?
97.4 But you will not be like them
against whom this word will be a
testimony:
“You have been associated with the
sinners.”
97.5 And in those days, the prayer of
the Holy will be in front of the Lord,
and for you will come the days of your
judgment.
97.6 And the words of your iniquity will
be read out before the Great and Holy
One, and your faces will blush with
shame, and every deed which is founded
upon iniquity will be rejected.
97.7 Woe to you, you sinners, who are
in the middle of the sea, or on dry
ground, their memory will be harmful to
you.
97.8 Woe to you who acquire silver and
gold, but not in righteousness, and say:
“We have become very rich and have
possessions, and have acquired
everything that we desired.
97.9 And now let us do what we
planned, for we have gathered silver and
filled our storehouses, and as many as
water are the servants of our houses.”
97.10 And like the water your life will
flow away, for your riches will not stay
with you, but will quickly go up from
you, for you acquired everything in
iniquity and you will be given over to a
great curse.
98.1 Now I swear to you, the wise,
and the foolish, that you will see many
51
things on the earth.
98.2 For you men will put on yourselves
more adornments than a woman, and
more coloured garments than a girl,
clothed in sovereignty, and in majesty,
and in power, and silver, and gold, and
purple, and honours, - and food will be
poured out like water.
98.3 Because of this they will have
neither knowledge nor wisdom. And
through this, they will be destroyed,
together with their possessions, and
with all their glory and their honour.
And in shame, and in slaughter, and in
great destitution, their spirits will be
thrown into the fiery furnace.
98.4 I swear to you, you sinners, that as
a mountain has not, and will not,
become a slave, nor a hill a woman's
maid, so sin was not sent on the Earth
but man, of himself, created it. And
those who commit it will be subject to a
great curse.
98.5 And barrenness has not been given
to a woman but because of the deeds of
her hand she dies without children.
98.6 I swear to you, you sinners, by the
Holy and Great One, that all your evil
deeds are revealed in Heaven and that
your wrongdoing is not covered or
hidden.
98.7 And do not think in your spirit nor
say in your heart, that you do not know,
or do not see, every sin is written down
every day in Heaven in front of the
Most High.
98.8 From now on, you know that all
your wrongdoing that you do will be
written down every day, until the day of
your judgment.
98.9 Woe to you, you fools, for you will
be destroyed through your folly. And
you do not listen to the wise and good
will not come upon you.
98.10 And now know that you are ready
for the day of destruction. And do not
hope that you will live, you sinners;
rather you will go and die, for you know
no ransom. You are ready for the Day
of the Great Judgment and for the day
of distress and great shame for your
spirits.
98.11 Woe to you, you stubborn of
heart who do evil and eat blood, from
where do you have good things to eat
and drink and to be satisfied? From all
the good things which our Lord the
Most High has placed in abundance on
the earth. Therefore you will not have
peace.
98.12 Woe to you who love deeds of
iniquity. Why do you hope for good for
yourselves? Know that you will be
given into the hands of the righteous,
and they will cut your throats and kill
you, and will not have mercy on you.
98.13 Woe to you who rejoice in the
distress of the righteous for graves will
not be dug for you.
98.14 Woe to you who declare the
words of the righteous empty for you
will have no hope of life.
98.15 Woe to you who write lying
words, and the words of the impious,
for they write their lies so that men may
hear and continue their folly. And they
will not have peace but will die a
sudden death.
99.1 Woe to you who do impious
deeds and praise and honour lying
words; you will be destroyed and will
not have a good life.
99.2 Woe to you who alter the words of
truth, and they distort the eternal law
and count themselves as being without
sin; they will be trampled underfoot on
the ground.
99.3 In those days make ready, you
righteous, to raise your prayers as a
reminder and lay them as a testimony
before the Angels, that they may lay the
sin of the sinners before the Most High
as a reminder.
99.4 In those days the nations will be
thrown into confusion and the races of
the nations will rise on the Day of
Destruction.
99.5 And in those days, those who are
in need will go out, seize their children,
52
and cast out their children. And their
offspring will slip from them, and they
will cast out their children while they
are still sucklings, and will not return to
them, and will not have mercy on their
beloved ones.
99.6 And again I swear to you, the
sinners, that sin is ready for the Day of
Unceasing Bloodshed.
99.7 And they worship stone, and some
carve images of gold and of silver, and
of wood and of clay. And some, with
no knowledge, worship unclean spirits
and demons, and every kind of error.
But no help will be obtained from them.
99.8 And they will sink into impiety
because of the folly of their hearts, and
their eyes will be blinded through the
fear of their hearts, and through the
vision of their ambitions.
99.9 Through these they will become
impious and fearful, for they do all their
deeds with lies, and worship stones, and
they will be destroyed at the same
moment.
99.10 And in those days, blessed are
those who accept the words of wisdom,
and understand them, and follow the
paths of the Most High, and walk in the
path of righteousness, and do not act
impiously with the impious, for they
will be saved.
99.11 Woe to you who extend evil to
your neighbours; for you will be killed
in Sheol.
99.12 Woe to you who lay foundations
of sin and deceit, and who cause
bitterness on the Earth, for because of
this an end will be made of them.
99.13 Woe to you who build your
houses with the toil of others, and all
their building materials are the sticks
and stones of sin; I say to you: “You
will not have peace.”
99.14 Woe to those who reject the
measure, and the eternal inheritance of
their fathers, and cause their souls to
follow error, for they will not have rest.
99.15 Woe to those who commit
iniquity, and help wrong, and kill their
neighbours, until the Day of the Great
Judgment; for he will throw down your
glory.
99.16 And you put evil into your hearts,
and rouse the spirit of his anger, so that
he may destroy you all with the sword.
And all the righteous and the Holy will
remember your sin.
100.1 And in those days, and in
one place, fathers and sons will strike
one another, and brothers will together
fall in death, until their blood flows as if
it were a stream.
100.2 For a man will not, in mercy,
withhold his hand from his sons, nor
from his son's sons, in order to kill
them. And the sinner will not withhold
his hand from his honoured brother
from dawn until the Sun sets they will
kill one another.
100.3 And the horse will walk up to its
chest in the blood of sinners and the
chariot will sink up to its height.
100.4 And in those days the Angels will
come down into the hidden places, and
gather together in one place all those
who have helped sin, and the Most High
will rise on that day to execute the Great
Judgment on all the sinners.
100.5 And he will set guards, from the
Holy Angels, over all the righteous and
Holy, and they will guard them like the
apple of an eye, until an end is made of
all evil and all sin. And even if the
righteous sleep a long sleep they have
nothing to fear.
100.6 And the wise men will see the
truth, and the sons of the Earth will
understand all the words of this book,
and they will know that their riches will
not be able to save them or overthrow
their sin.
100.7 Woe to you, you sinners, when
you afflict the righteous on the day of
severe trouble, and burn them with fire,
you will be repaid according to your
deeds.
100.8 Woe to you, you perverse of heart
who watch to devise evil; fear will come
53
upon you and there is no one who will
help you.
100.9 Woe to you, you sinners, for an
account of the words of your mouth,
and for an account of the deeds of your
hands that you have impiously done;
you will burn in blazing flames of fire.
100.10 And now know that the Angels
will inquire in Heaven into your deeds,
from the Sun and the Moon and the
Stars, into your sins, for on earth you
execute judgment on the righteous.
100.11 And all the clouds and mist and
dew and rain will testify against you, for
they will be withheld from you so that
they do not fall on you, and they will
think about your sins.
100.12 And now give gifts to the rain,
so that it may not be withheld from
falling on you, and so that the dew, if it
has accepted gold and silver from you,
may fall.
100.13 When the hoarfrost and snow,
with their cold, and all the snow-winds
with their torments fall on you. In those
days, you will not be able to stand
before them.
101.1 Contemplate Heaven, all you
sons of Heaven, and all the works of the
Most High, and fear him, and do not do
evil in front of Him.
101.2 If He closes the Windows of
Heaven, and withholds the rain and the
dew, so that it does not fall on the earth
because of you, what will you do?
101.3 And if he sends his anger upon
you, and upon all your deeds, will you
not entreat him? For you speak proud
and hard against his righteousness. And
you will not have peace.
101.4 And do you not see the captains
of the ships; how their ships are tossed
by the waves and rocked by the winds
and are in distress?
101.5 And because of this they are
afraid, for all their good possessions
that go out on the sea with them, and
they think nothing good in their hearts,
only that the sea will swallow them up,
and that they will be destroyed in it.
101.6 Is not all the sea, and all its
waters, and all its movement, the work
of the Most High, and did he not seal all
it’s doings and bind it all with sand?
101.7 And at his rebuke it dries up and
becomes afraid, and all its fish die, and
everything in it; but you sinners who are
on Earth do not fear him.
101.8 Did he not make Heaven, Earth,
and everything that is in them? And
who gave knowledge, and wisdom, to
all things that move on the ground and
in the sea?
101.9 And do not those captains of the
ships fear the sea?
Yet, sinners do not fear the Most High.
102.1 And in those days, if he
brings a fierce fire upon you, where will
you flee, and where will you be safe?
And when he utters his voice against
you will you not be terrified and afraid?
102.2 And all the Lights will shake with
great fear, and the whole Earth will be
terrified, and will tremble and quail.
102.3 And all the Angels will carry out
their commands, and will seek to hide
from the One who is Great in Glory,
and the children of the Earth will
tremble and shake; and you sinners will
be cursed forever and will not have
peace.
102.4 Do not be afraid you souls of the
righteous, and be hopeful, you who
have died in righteousness.
102.5 And do not be sad that your souls
have gone down into Sheol in sadness
and that your bodies did not obtain
during your life a reward in accordance
with your goodness.
102.6 But when you die the sinners will
say about you: “As we die, the
righteous have also died, and of what
use to them were their deeds?”
102.7 “Behold, like us they have died in
sadness and in darkness, and what
advantage do they have over us? From
now on we are equal.”
102.8 “And what will they receive and
54
what will they see forever? For behold,
they too have died, and from now on
they will never again see the light.”
102.9 And I say to you, you sinners:
“You are content to eat and drink, and
strip men naked, and steal, and sin, and
acquire possessions, and see good days.
102.10 But you saw the righteous, how
their end was peace, for no wrong was
found in them until the day of their
death.”
102.11 “But they were destroyed and
became as though they had not been and
their souls went down to Sheol in
distress.”
103.1 And now I swear to you, the
righteous, by His Great Glory and His
Honour, and by His Magnificent
Sovereignty, and by His Majesty: - I
swear to you that I understand this
mystery.
103.2 And I have read the Tablets of
Heaven and seen the writing of the Holy
Ones. And I found written and
engraved in it, concerning them, that all
good, and joy, and honour, have been
made ready, and written down, for the
spirits of those who died in
righteousness.
103.3 And much good will be given to
you in recompense for your toil and that
your lot will be more excellent than the
lot of the living.
103.4 And the spirits of you who have
died in righteousness will live, and your
spirits will rejoice and be glad, and the
memory of them will remain in front of
the Great One for all the generations of
eternity. Therefore do not fear their
abuse.
103.5 Woe to you, you sinners, when
you die in your sin, and those who are
like you say about you: “Blessed were
the sinners they saw their days.
103.6 And now they have died in
prosperity and wealth, distress and
slaughter they did not see during their
life, but they have died in glory, and
judgment was not executed on them in
their life.”
103.7 Know that their souls will be
made to go down into Sheol, they will
be wretched, and their distress will be
great.
103.8 And in darkness, and in chains,
and in burning flames, your spirits will
come to the Great Judgment. And the
Great Judgment will last for all
generations, forever. Woe to you for
you will not have peace.
103.9 Do not say, the righteous and the
good who were alive; “In the days of
our affliction we toiled laboriously, and
saw every affliction, and met many
evils. We were spent and became few
and our spirit small.
103.10 We were destroyed and there
was no one who helped us with words
or with deeds. We were powerless and
found nothing. We were tortured and
destroyed and did not expect to see life
from one day to the next.
103 11 We hoped to become the head
but became the tail. We toiled and
laboured, but were not masters of the
fruits of our toil; we became food for
the sinners, and the lawless made their
yoke heavy upon us.
103.12 Those who hated us, those who
goaded us, were masters of us. And to
those who hated us we bowed our necks
but they did not have mercy on us.
103.13 We sought to escape from them
so that we might flee and be at rest. But
we found no place where we might flee
and be safe from them.
103.14 We complained about them to
the rulers, in our distress, and cried out
against those who devoured us, but they
took no notice of our cries, and did not
wish to listen to our voice.
103.15 And they helped those who
plundered us and devoured us, and
those who made us few, and they
concealed their wrongdoing, and did not
remove from us the yoke of those who
devoured us, and scattered us, and killed
us. And they concealed our slaughter
and did not remember that they had
55
raised their hands against us.”
104.1 I swear to you, you
righteous, that in Heaven the Angels
remember you for good in front of the
Glory of the Great One, and that your
names are written down in front of the
Glory of the Great One.
104.2 Be hopeful! For you were
formerly put to shame through evils and
afflictions, but now you will shine like
the Lights of Heaven, and will be seen,
and the Gate of Heaven will be opened
to you.
104.3 And persevere in your cry for
judgment and it will appear to you, for
justice will be exacted from the rulers
for all your distress, and from all those
who helped those who plundered you.
104.4 Be hopeful, and do not abandon
your hope, for you will have great joy
like the Angels of Heaven.
104.5 What will you have to do? You
will not have to hide on the day of the
Great Judgment, nor will you be found
to be sinners. The Eternal Judgment
will be upon you for all the generations
of eternity.
104.6 And now do not be afraid, you
righteous, when you see the sinners
growing strong and prospering in their
desires, and do not be associated with
them but keep far away from their
wrongdoing, for you will be associates
of the Host of Heaven.
104.7 For you sinners say: “None of
our sins will be inquired into and
written down!” But they will write
down your sins every day.
104.8 And now I show you that light
and darkness, day and night, see all your
sins.
104.9 Do not be impious in your hearts,
and do not lie, and do not alter the
words of truth, nor say that the words of
the Holy and Great One are lies, and do
not praise your idols. For all your lies,
and all your impiety, lead not to
righteousness but to great sin.
104.10 And now I know this mystery;
that many sinners will alter and distort
the words of truth, and speak evil
words, and lie, and concoct great
fabrications, and write books in their
own words.
104.11 But when they write my words
exactly in their languages, and do not
alter or omit anything from my words,
but write everything exactly, everything
that I testified about before; then I know
another mystery:
104.12 That books will be given to the
righteous and wise and will be a source
of joy and truth and much wisdom.
104.13 And books will be given to
them, and they will believe in them and
rejoice over them; and all the righteous
who have learnt from them all the ways
of truth will be glad.
105.1 And in those days, says the
Lord, they shall call and testify to the
sons of the Earth about the wisdom in
them. Show it to them for you are their
leaders and the rewards will be over all
the Earth.
105.2 For my son and I will join
ourselves with them, forever, in the
paths of uprightness during their lives.
And you will have peace.
Rejoice - you sons of uprightness!
Amen
Fragment of the Book of Noah
106.1 And after those days my son
Methuselah chose a wife for his son
Lamech and she became pregnant by
him and bore a son.
106.2 And his body was white like
snow, and red like the flower of a rose,
and the hair of his head was white like
wool. And his eyes were beautiful and
when he opened his eyes he made the
whole house bright, like the Sun, so that
the whole house was exceptionally
bright.
106.3 And when he was taken from the
56
hand of the midwife he opened his
mouth and spoke to the Lord of
Righteousness.
106.4 And his father Lamech was afraid
of him, and fled, and went to his father
Methuselah.
106.5 And he said to him: "I have
begotten a strange son; he is not like a
man but is like the children of the
Angels of Heaven, of a different type
and not like us. And his eyes are like
the rays of the Sun and his face
glorious.
106.6 And it seems to me that he is not
sprung from me but from the Angels
and I am afraid that something
extraordinary may be done on the earth
in his days.
106.7 And now, my father, I am
entreating you and petitioning you, to
go to our father Enoch, and learn from
him the truth, for his dwelling is with
the Angels."
106.8 And when Methuselah heard the
words of his son he came to me, at the
ends of the Earth, for he had heard that I
was there. And he cried out, and I heard
his voice and went to him. And I said
to him: "Behold I am here my son, for
you have come to me."
106.9 And he answered me, and said:
"Because of a great matter I have come
to you, and because of a disturbing
vision, have I come near.
106.10 And now hear me, my father, for
a child has been born to my son
Lamech, whose form and type are not
like the type of a man. His colour is
whiter than snow, and redder than the
flower of the rose, and the hair of his
head is whiter than white wool. And his
eyes are like the rays of the Sun; and he
opened his eyes and made the whole
house bright.
106.11 And he was taken from the hand
of the midwife, and he opened his
mouth, and blessed the Lord of Heaven.
106.12 And his father Lamech was
afraid and fled to me. And he does not
believe he is sprung from him but thinks
him to be from the Angels of Heaven.
And behold, I have come to you, so that
you may make known to me the truth."
106.13 And I, Enoch, answered and said
to him: "The Lord will do new things
on Earth, and this I have already seen in
a vision, and made known to you. For
in the generation of my father, Jared,
some from the height of Heaven
transgressed the word of the Lord.
106.14 And behold, they commit sin
and transgress the law, and have been
promiscuous with women, and commit
sin with them, and have married some
of them, and have begotten children by
them.
106.15 And there will be great
destruction over the whole Earth, and
there will be a deluge, and there will be
great destruction for one year.
106.16 But this child, who has been
born to you, will be left on the Earth,
and his three sons will be saved with
him. When all the men who are on the
Earth die he and his sons will be saved.
106.17 They will beget on the Earth
giants, not of spirit, but of flesh, and
there will be great wrath on Earth, and
the Earth will be cleansed of all
corruption.
106.18 And now make known to your
son Lamech that the one who has been
born is truly his son. And call his name
Noah, for he will be a remnant for you
and he and his sons will be saved from
the destruction which is coming on the
earth because of all the sin and all the
iniquity, which will be committed on
the Earth in his days.
106.19 But after this, there will be yet
greater iniquity than that which was
committed on the earth before. For I
know the mysteries of the Holy Ones,
for the Lord showed them to me and
made them known to me, and I read
them in the Tablets of Heaven.
107.1 And I saw written on them,
that generation upon generation will do
wrong, until a generation of
57
righteousness shall arise, and
wrongdoing shall be destroyed, and sin
shall depart from the earth, and
everything good shall come upon it.
107.2 And now, my son, go, make
known to your son Lamech, that this
child that has been born, is truly his son,
and this is no lie.
107.3 And when Methuselah had heard
the words of his father Enoch - for he
showed him everything which is secret -
he returned, having seen him, and called
the name of that child Noah; for he will
comfort the Earth after all the
destruction.
108.1 Another book which Enoch
wrote for his son Methuselah and for
those who should come after him and
keep the law in the last days.
108.2 You who have observed, and are
waiting in these days, until an end shall
be made of those who do evil, and an
end shall be made of the power of the
wrongdoers.
108.3 Do indeed wait until sin shall pass
away, for their names shall be erased
from the Books of the Holy Ones, and
their offspring will be destroyed
forever. And their spirits will be killed,
and they will cry out and moan in a
chaotic desert place, and will burn in
fire, for there is no Earth there.
108.4 And there I saw something like a
cloud, which could not be discerned, for
because of its depth I was not able to
look into it. And the flames of a fire I
saw, burning brightly, and things like
bright mountains revolved and shook
from side to side.
108.5 And I asked one of the Holy
Angels, who were with me, and I said to
him: “What is this bright place? For
there is no sky, but only the flames of a
burning fire, and the sounds of crying,
and weeping, and moaning, and severe
pain.”
108.6 And he said to me: “This place
which you see; here will be thrown the
spirits of the sinners, and of the
blasphemers, and of those who do evil.
And of those who alter everything that
the Lord has spoken through the mouths
of the prophets about the things that
shall be done.
108.7 For there are books, and records,
about them in Heaven above so that the
Angels may read them and know what
is about to come upon the sinners. And
upon the spirits of the humble, and of
those who afflicted their bodies and
were recompensed by God, and of those
who were abused by evil men.
108.8 Those who loved God and did not
love gold, or silver, or any possessions,
but gave up their bodies to torment.
108.9 Those who, from the moment
they existed, did not desire earthly food,
but counted themselves as a breath
which passes away, and kept to this.
And the Lord tested them much, and
their spirits were found pure, so that
they might bless His Name.”
108.10 And all their blessings I have
recounted in the books, and he has
assigned them their reward, for they
were found to be such that they loved
Heaven more than their life in the
world. And although they were
trampled underfoot by evil men, and
had to listen to reviling and reproach
from them, and were abused, yet they
blessed their Lord.
108.11 And the Lord said: “And now I
will call the spirits of the good, who are
of the Generation of Light, and I will
transform those who were born in
darkness, who in the flesh were not
recompensed with honour as was fitting
to their faith.
108.12 And I will bring out into the
shining light those who love my Holy
Name and I will set each one on the
throne of his honour.”
108.13 And they will shine for times
without number, for righteous is the
Judgment of God, for with the faithful
He will keep faith in the dwelling of
upright paths.
58
108.14 And they will see those who
were born in darkness thrown into the
darkness while the righteous shine.
108.15 And the sinners will cry out as
they see them shining but they
themselves will go where days and
times have been written down for them.
