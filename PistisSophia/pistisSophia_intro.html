<H1>Pistis Sophia: The Books of the Savior</H1>An Introduction by G.R.S. Mead 
</CENTER>
<HR>

<H3>Arhcive Notes</H3>
<P>The following introductory comments are extracted from G.R.S. Mead, <I>Pistis 
Sophia: A Gnostic Gospel</I>, pp. xxxix - l. It should be remember that this 
introduction was written in 1921, decades before the discovery of the Nag 
Hammadi Library, and at a time when the <I>Pistis Sophia </I>was one of the most 
important and largest collections of Gnostic material available to scholars. 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>An Excerpt from the Introduction to Pistis Sophia</H3>
<P><B>by G.R.S. Mead</B> </P>
<P>We have in the contents of the Askew, Bruce and Berlin Codices a rich 
material which hands on to us valuable direct information concerning what I have 
called 'The Gnosis according to its Friends,' in distinction from what 
previously used to be our only sources, the polemical writings of the 
heresiological Fathers, which set forth 'The Gnosis according to its Foes.' We 
have thus at last a new standpoint from which to review the subject, and 
therewith the opportunity of revising our impressions in a number of respects; a 
considerably different angle of vision must needs change the perspective of no 
little in the picture. </P>
<P>The chief business or interest of the orthodox Fathers was to select and 
stress what appeared to them to be the most bizarre points and elements, all 
that was most absurd in their judgment, in the many Gnostic systems, and of 
course, and rightly, everything that could be thought to be ethically 
reprehensible. Good, bad and indifferent were only too frequently lumped 
together. It was of no interest to this polemic to mention similarities in 
belief and practice between the heretics and their opponents, to dwell on the 
lofty faith of numbers of these Gnostics in the transcendent excellence and 
overmastering glory of the Savior or on many signs of spiritual inwardness, and 
especially of high virtue, in which they were at the least not less scrupulous 
than their critics. Doubtless there were sects and groups whose tenets were 
absurd at any valuation, and some whose laxity of ethics demanded severe 
reprobation. But the majority could not be accused on the score of moral 
delinquency, indeed no few were rigidly ascetic; and some of their speculations 
again have a sublimity of their own, and in a number of cases anticipated 
Catholic dogma. If we turn to our direct sources in Coptic translation, we find 
that the ethic is admirable, even if we are averse from over-asceticism in the 
religious life, and that their whole-souled devotion to and worship of the 
Saviour is unbounded. </P>
<P>It is no part of the plan of this translation to attempt anything in the 
nature of a commentary. That would mean a second volume, and would in any case 
be an unsatisfactory performance; for much would still remain obscure, even if 
every ray of light shed on this or that special point by those who have most 
deeply studied the subject, were gathered together. One or two very general 
remarks, however, may be ventured. </P>
<P>u In the P.S. Jesus is everywhere pre-eminent and central. He is here 
revealed as Saviour and First Mystery, who knows all and unveils all, infinite 
in compassion. As such he is pre-existent from eternity, and his ministry is not 
only earthly, but cosmic and supercosmic; indeed, it is the chief feature in the 
divine economy. Yet nowhere is he called the Christ. If this is intentional, no 
reason seems to be assignable for such an abstention. There is no sign of 
antagonism to Judaism or to the O.T. On the contrary, the psalms and other 
utterances which are quoted, are validated by the theory that it was the Power 
of the Saviour which 80 prophesied of old through the mouth of a David, a 
Solomon, or an Isaiah. </P>
<P>The whole setting is post-resurrectional. In Div v. i.-iii Jesus has already, 
for eleven years after the crucifixion, been instructing his disciples, men and 
women, in the Gnosis. The scene now depicts the disciples as gathered round the 
Saviour on the Mount of Olives on earth. The range and scope of this prior 
teaching may be seen in Div. iv., where the introductory words speak of it as 
taking place simply after the crucifixion. In this stratum the scene is 
different. The sacramental rite is solemnized on earth; it takes place, however, 
on the Mount of Galilee and not on the Mount of Olives. But the scene is not 
confined to earth only, for the disciples are also taken into some of the 
regions of the invisible world, above and below, have vision there conferred 
upon them, and are instructed on its meaning. Now in Div v. i.-iii. Jesus 
promises to take the disciples into the spheres and heavens for the direct 
showing of the nature and quality and inhabitants, but there is no fulfillment 
of this promise in the excerpts we have from ' The Books of the savior.' It is 
not to be supposed, however, that Div. iv. is part of the fulfillment of the 
high promise made in the prior extracts; for in it we move in an earlier phase 
of the instruction and in an atmosphere of lesser mysteries than those indicated 
in the preceding part. </P>
<P>Div v. i.-iii. throughout proclaim the revelation of higher mysteries. This 
is only now made possible by the supremely joyous fact that in the twelfth year 
of the inner-teaching-ministry a great, If not supreme, moment in the life of 
the Saviour has been accomplished; his earthly ministry is now achieved, and he 
is invested with the full radiance of his triple robe of glory, which embraces 
the whole powers of the universe. He ascends into heaven in dazzling light which 
blinds the disciples. After thirty hours he returns again, and in compassion 
withdraws his blinding splendour, 60 as to give his final teaching to his 
faithful in his familiar form. This means that ' The Books of the Saviour' 
purport to contain not only a post-resurrectional teaching, and therefore a 
Gnostic revelation supplementary to the public preaching before the crucifixion, 
but also a still higher and more intimate unveiling within the 
post-resurrectional instruction already current in the tradition. If there had 
been apocalyptic elements and visions in the prior literature, there were to be 
still more transcendental revelations now on the completion of the ministry. 
Until the investiture, or rather reinvestiture, had taken place according to the 
divine command, it had not been possible for the Saviour to speak in utter 
openness face to face on all things; now it is possible. Such is the convention. 
</P>
<P>In Div v. i.-iii. there is presupposed throughout a system of eons and the 
rest, which is already highly complex and shows manifest signs of consisting of 
stage once severally at the summit of earlier systems, but now successively 
subordinated. It is clear then that, if still loftier hierarchies are to be 
brought on to the stage, it can only be by again reducing what had previously 
been regarded as 'the end of all ends ' to a subordinate position. This is the 
method adopted, and we lose ourselves in the recital of the designations and 
attributes of ever more transcendental beings and spaces and mysteries. </P>
<P>In all of this, however, there is no sign of interest in metaphysical 
speculation; there is no philosophizing.. It is then not any element of Hellenic 
thought proper in the aeonology, which is said to have been so strongly the case 
with the teaching of Valentinus himself, that has led so many to conjecture a 
Valentinian derivation. It is rather the long episode of the sorrowing Sophia 
which has influenced them. This episode reflects on a lower level of the cosmic 
scale somewhat of the motif of the ' tragic myth' of the world-soul the 
invention of which is generally ascribed to Valentinus himself, though he may 
possibly have transformed or worked up already existing materials or notions. It 
is this long Sophia episode and its skillfully inverted mystical exegesis and 
allegorical interpretation, following the method developed by Alexandrine 
contemplatives which has produced the impression on many that it was of 
fundamental importance for the system of the P.S. </P>
<P>It is certainly an indication of the deep interest of the circle in 
repentance and the penitential psalms. But the interest is here ethical rather 
than cosmological. Pistis Sophia would seem ~o be intended to represent the type 
of the faithful repentant individual soul. Throughout, the chief interest is in 
salvation and redemption. This i8 to be acquired by repentance and by 
renunciation of the world, its lures and cares, but above all by faith in the 
Saviour, the Divine Light, and his mysteries. The first requisite is sincere 
repentance. The chief topic round which all the ethical teaching naturally 
centres, is sin, its cause and its purification, and the revelation of the 
mystery of the forgiveness of sins and of the infinite compassion of the First 
Mystery. Though there i8 very much also concerning the complex schematology of 
the invisible worlds and the hierarchies of being, much concerning the soul and 
its origin, of how it comes to birth and departs from earth-life, much of the 
light-power, the spiritual element in man,-all is subordinated to the ethical 
interest in the first place, and in the second to the efficacy of the high 
mysteries of salvation. </P>
<P>The whole is set forth in terms of these mysteries, which are now conceived 
in a far more vital way than was apparently the case in the earlier literature. 
On the lower side the mysteries still in some respects keep in touch with the 
tradition of words-of-power, authentic and incorruptible names, and so forth, 
though there is little of this specifically in Div v. i.-iii. But it is 
evidently intended that the higher mysteries should now be conceived in the 
light of the fact that the Saviour himself is in himself concretely the First 
Mystery and indeed the Last Mystery, and that -the mysteries are not so much 
spiritual powers as substantive beings of transcendent excellence The light-robe 
is a mystery of mysteries, and they who have received of the high mysteries 
become light-streams in passing from the body. The mysteries are closely 
intertwined with the lore of the glory and its modes. </P>
<P>One of the main elements in the lower schematology isthe ancient astral lore, 
those ground-conceptions of sidereal religion which dominated the thought of the 
times and upheld their sway directly and indirectly for long centuries after. 
But here again our Gnostic, while retaining the schematology for certain 
purposes, placed it low in the scale. Moreover, while not denying that 
previously there was truth even in the astrological art, they reduced the 
chances of the horoscope-casters to zero, by declaring that the Saviour in the 
accomplishment of his cosmic ministry had now drastically changed the revolution 
of the spheres, so that henceforth no calculations could be counted on; these 
were now of no more value than the spinning of a coin. </P>
<P>Our Gnostics were also tranmigrationists ; transcorporation formed an 
integral part of their system. They found no difficulty in fitting it into their 
plan of salvation, which show no sign of the expectation of an immediate end of 
all things -that prime article of faith of the earliest days. So far from 
thinking that reincarnation is alien to gospel-teaching, they elaborately 
interpret certain of the most striking sayings in this sense, and give graphic 
details of how Jesus, as the First Mystery, brought to rebirth the souls of John 
the Baptizer and of the disciples, and supervised the economy of his own 
incarnation. In this respect the P.S. offers richer material for those 
interested in this ancient and widespread doctrine than can be found in any 
other old-world document in the West. </P>
<P>A far more distressingly puzzling immixture is the element of magic. In Div. 
iv. especially there are invocations and many names which resemble those found 
in the Greek magical papyri and other scattered sources. But no one has so far 
thrown any clear light on this most difficult subject of research in general, 
much less on its relation to the P.S. It is evident that the writers of Div. iv. 
and of the first treatise of the Bruce Codex set a high value on such formula 
and on authentic names; nor are these entirely absent from the excerpts from 
'The Books of the Saviour' as witness the five words written on the lightrobe. 
Our Gnostics unquestionably believed in a high magic, and were not averse from 
finding in what was presumably its most reputable tradition, material which they 
considered to be germane to their purpose. In this tradition there must have 
been a supreme personage possessing characteristics that could be brought into 
close connection with their ideal of the Saviour, for they equate a certain 
Aberamentho with him. The name occurs once or twice elsewhere; but who or what 
it suggested, we do not know. In any case, as they utilized and attempted to 
sublimate so much else which was considered by many in those days to be most 
venerable, in order that they might the more extend and exalt the glory of the 
Saviour and take up into it what they considered the best of everything, so did 
they with what was presumably the highest they could find in the hoary tradition 
of magical power, which had enjoyed empery for so long in the antique world and 
still continued to maintain itself even in religio-philosophical circles, where 
we should, from the modern standpoint, least expect to find it. </P>
<P>As to the setting of the narrative,-if we had not such an abundance of 
instances of pseudohistoric and pseudo-epigraphic scripture-writing, if this 
were not, so to speak, the commonplace, not only of apocryphal and apocalyptic 
literature, but also of no little that falls within the borders of canonical 
sanction, we might be more surprised than we are at the form in which the 
composers or compilers have framed their work. It is clear that they loved and 
worshipped Jesus with an ecstasy of devotion and exaltation; they do not fall 
short in this of the greatest of his lovers. What sort of authority, then, could 
they have Supposed they had for conceiving the setting of their narrative in the 
way they have ? </P>
<P>Objective physical history, in the rigid sense in which we understand it 
to-day, was of secondary interest to them, to say the least; indeed, it was 
apparently of little moment to the Gnostics of any school, and their opponents 
were not infrequently rowing in the same boat. The Gnostics were, however, less 
disingenuous; they strenuously declared their belief in continued revelation, 
they delighted in apocalyptic and in psychic story. The belief in a 
post-resurrectional teaching had doubtless existed for long in many forms in 
Gnostic circles. It must have been widespread; for, as shown by Schmidt quite 
recently (Bib. 59), a (Catholic writer in Asia Minor found himself compelled to 
steal the fire of the Gnostics and adopt the same convention in an orthodox 
document that was intended to be a polemic against Gnostic ideas, somewhere in 
the 3rd quarter of the 2nd century. However they arrived at their conviction, it 
seems highly probable that the writers of the P.S. must have sincerely believed 
they had high authority for their proceeding, and were in some way emboldened by 
' inspiration ' to carry out their task. As far as they were concerned, they do 
not by any means seem conscious of belonging to a decadent movement or of 
deterioration in the quality of the ideas they were attempting to set forth, as 
so many modern critics would have it. On the contrary, they thought they were 
depositories or recipients of profound mysteries never hitherto revealed, and 
that by a knowledge of these mysteries they could the more efficiently 
evangelize the world. </P>
<P>It is evident, however, that the P.S. was never intended to be circulated as 
a public gospel. Certain things are to be preached or proclaimed to the world, 
but only certain things. Certain mysteries, again, the recipients were to bestow 
under certain conditions, but others were to be reserved. The ' Books of the 
Saviour ' are, therefore, to be regarded as apocrypha in the original sense of 
the word-that is, ' withdrawn ' or ' reserved ' writings. As such they fell 
within the proscriptions of artificial secrecy common to all the initiatory 
institutions of the time and of all time. And artificial secrecy can with 
difficulty, if ever, avoid the moral and intellectual hazard of its innate 
obscurations. The P.S. was intended for already initiated disciples, for chosen 
learners, though ~o pledge of secrecy is mentioned. It was intended, above all, 
for would-be apostles, for those who should go forth to proclaim what was for 
them the best of good news; it is clearly the inner instruction of a zealously 
propagandist sect. </P>
<P>If ' The Books of the Saviour ' in their full original form - for in the 
extant P.S. we have but selections from them and the formula of the higher 
mysteries are omitted,-and if what is given of the lower mysteries in Div. iv. 
were held back from public perusal owing partly at least to the fear of the 
unworthy making improper use of them, there is little danger to-day on this 
score, for this part of the miscellany remains so far the most securely 
incomprehensible. And indeed no little else remains obscure, even when we are of 
those who have made a protracted study of the psychical elements in mysticism 
and of the general psychology of religious experience. But there is much also in 
our codex which has a charm of its own. There are things of rare, if exotic, 
beauty, things of profound ethical significance, things of delicate spiritual 
texture. </P>
<P>In any case, however all these very various elements and features in the 
syncretism be judged and evaluated, the Pistis Sophia is unquestionably a 
document of the first importance, not only for the history of Christianized 
Gnosticism, but also for the history of the development of religion in the West.
